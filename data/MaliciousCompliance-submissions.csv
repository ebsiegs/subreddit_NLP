2021-08-01 17:04:29,Got into a heavily guarded United Nations refugee camp by .... walking in.,"I was inspired to write this story after reading [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/ovy80b/underage_teenager_gets_into_an_r_rated_movie_by/)...

The year is 1999. The former country of Yugoslavia has fallen apart and Kosovo is fighting for independence. I have family living in Kosovo and they have fled to neighboring Macedonia. The United Nations has housed them in a large refugee camp outside of Macedonia's capital, Skopje.

My father (who was born there) had lots of relatives in the camp. Brothers with their entire family and a number of cousins. We traveled there together after his employer of 25 years, in an awesome act of support, gave him $20,000 cash, tickets, and a phone number to call if he needed more help.

After 2 days of travel we arrive at the camp, only to be turned away: family members could not access it without a letter from the Red Cross. It turns out that the camp was more like a prison. Nobody could get in or out without authorization, presumably to prevent bad guys from coming in. We go to Skopje and get the letter. Except: only one person was allowed in.

My father goes in and I wait outside. While I'm waiting, I see tons of people walking in and out, flashing nothing more than a badge. Some are UN, some are local Red Cross, some or vendors. This is when I hatch my plan. At the time, the country we lived in issued personal ID cards which were semi-floppy laminated cards, about the size of two credit cards. I walked back to the car and retrieved the lanyard that I use for my work badge. I put my ID on there and in the distance I wait for a shift change.

After the shift change, I simply walked straight through the gate while flashing my ID. The guarding soldiers had no clue whatsoever and didn't even blink an eye.

I found my dad and the rest of the family, and a few days later we had almost 30 family members on a refugee flight for temporary asylum. They returned after two years and Kosovo is now an independent country.",MaliciousCompliance,1627859069,a56-7w,0,1,self-post
2021-08-01 16:41:19,My boss wants to work all his employees 14+ hours a day cause he can’t keep anyone around? Ok then,"Super short and sweet post, my boss has serious trouble keeping employees. Any new person he hires, he makes them work 6 days a week, 10+ hours a day. Most don’t make it a month because of this. So recently we had a severe lack of employees and all employees had 0% morale so what we do have was going very slow. So that made brought us to easily working 14-16 hours a day. So me, and 2 other senior people just quit on the spot. Now he’s gonna get fired cause the entire warehouse is going up in flames struggling to keep up with demand.",MaliciousCompliance,1627857679,LoanSurviver101,0,1,self-post
2021-08-01 15:02:25,Staff buying anything to eat must get receipt signed and tape to product..,"I was the assistant manager in a discount retailer.  

Every few days, someone in corporate would come up with an idea, designed to look good on paper in an office somewhere I'm sure, maybe a beautiful PowerPoint display or an Excel sheet loaded with formulas, all fantastic in theory, but painful to implement in real life.

On this day, an email came, basically that from here forward, anything purchased by staff that was going to be in the staff area would have to have a manager signed till receipt attached.  There would be 2 days grace and then anything found on the next area manager call would be noted and binned immediately.  So regardless if this was a sandwich and a drink for lunch, jar of coffee or a full shop it would be binned.  Cameras everywhere except the toilet cubicles wasn't enough, let's let these guys on a pittance know we trust them less than Chris Chan in an old folks home.  I didn't know what Chris Chan was this morning.  I wish I didn't know now. 

The company, unable to hold manager's,  were on a huge recruitment drive, rather than promote from within, they decided to promote from outside to fill the positions faster.  So my store gets a new store manager, with limited previous experience and out to make his name in the company.  Immediately he hits the canteen, bins everything with no receipt, everything, food and non food.  He doesn't give a crap.  The staff are pissed. Word travels fast.



 Now I've paid my dues between the on trade and retail.  I started at the bottom, sorting bottles for recycling as a kid. And i know enough to know that, I, and my collegues are only numbers in the corporate machine.  Disposable, replacable, an necessary inconvenience that is to be treated as such and never to be treated as equal to the customer even when they are the customer.

Corporate never considered for a moment just how much the staff spent. 45-50 people throughout the week supplementing the sales.  Understand that when someone is on a timed break, remembering the receipt is not a priority, and then  trying to find a manager to sign it, I know I'd often be in the cash office counting tills, and company policy didn't let you leave that room in the middle of a count with a safe open. So by the time a signature was obtained a fair chunk of your 15 or 30mon break was gone, and at your own expense. And this applied to me aswell. I was expected to get whoever was on with me to sign my receipts.

I had a very quick meeting with everyone I'd see over the next few days explaining this new piece of stupidity, and why there coffee, sugar, etc had vanished and that it was entirely the new guy. I also pointed out, very clearly, that Anything purchased in the major retailer directly opposite was outside of the scope of our employer, and could not be touched, and needed no receipts, or proof of any kind. And if it was touched I would report it directly to the highest available person I could get, bypassing the area management.

It took 3 weeks before the call came.  In that time we Stuck to the rules to the letter. The store was down on its week on week figure against last year for the last couple of weeks by a few hundred.  Guess why?

Area manager arrives to investigate how the new store manager is letting the figures slip. Pulls me aside and says what the funk is happening with this drop off?? I explain what happened how all the staff food and stuff was tossed out with no concern, and how with this situation the only option is to shop elsewhere.  

He looks shocked like,  how could these idiots do this?  He goes off on his phone.  Comes back, calls me and new guy into office. Says unofficially revert to normal, this is the only blip in my area, get these figure right for next week.

It was too late to fix the next week but within 2 weeks we were OK and new guy was seen as the saviour and got a move to a brand new store and lasted a month before his team turned on him. End.

Is this maliciously compliant enough? I dont even know.",MaliciousCompliance,1627851745,q2005,0,1,self-post
2021-08-01 13:09:22,Underage Teenager Gets Into an R rated movie by showing me his ID,"I was once the victim of, what I assume, to be malicious compliance.

This happened to me a few years back. I used to work at my local movie theater. One of our jobs was to tear people's tickets, and direct them to the correct theater (shifts for this lasted like 7-8 hours, so yeah it was pretty dull but whatever).

Our theater also had ticket kiosks where you could purchase tickets at a machine. When printed, these tickets are clearly marked and labelled as kiosk tickets. The reason for this is because if someone purchases tickets for an R rated movie we're supposed to check their ID if they look like they're under 25. And the ticket tearer is trained to ask those who look like they might be underage for their IDs if they purchased their ticket at a Kiosk and not at the Box Office. I've had many, many cases where underage kids thought they were just so smart to purchase tickets for R rated films at a machine and bypass the worker at the box office, without realizing there was no way they could bypass the ticket-tearer (when that happened, I usually radioed for a manager, who would refund them the money).

Anyway this happened on a relatively lazy weekday afternoon. Two teenagers (a boy and a girl who I assume were on a date) walked up to me. The guy handed me the two tickets. I glance at it and… yep, it's a Kiosk ticket for an R rated movie (I forget which one).

Me: Can I see your IDs?

Guy: Of course!

Without the slightest bit of hesitation in his motions, he smoothly hands me both of their IDs.

I glance at them, tear the tickets, hand everything back to them, and direct them to the correct auditorium. They thank me and walk past me.

So you're probably wondering, why exactly is this MC?

Well, after the kid and his girlfriend had made their way inside, my brain finally caught up with what the date on the Driver's Licenses had actually said, and it hit me like Ivan Drago; the kid and his date were 16, not 17. This kid had managed to smooth-talk his way into seeing an R rated film, by doing exactly what he was told; showing me their IDs. And since he'd done so with the utmost confidence and without an iota of a hint that he had anything to hide, I had barely gave the birthdates a second thought. I'd been played.

I could've radioed for a manager to kick them out, but honestly I was just too impressed by the balls on that kid, so I let this one slide.

Honestly, I think that kid is going places.",MaliciousCompliance,1627844962,jsrrayburn,0,1,self-post

2021-08-01 12:35:02,My daughter pretending she didn’t hear me so she could swear more.,"Me and my daughter, aged 9, have a rule that if I ever say a bad word in conversation to her, she’s allowed to say that word, and she sometimes saves them to use later. I rarely swear, and never say any really bad words in front of her, we’re talking “piss”, “bitch” and “dickhead”.

She kept trying to find ways to get me to swear at her, by calling me “little boobs” hoping I would tell her to piss off (I would never say it aggressive, more joking back with her and she knows this). But it wasn’t working.

So the other week, it was the night before her school trip, and I checked the weather and said, “it’s going to be pissing it down all day tomorrow” (British term for raining heavily). She looks up and says, “What?” So I repeat myself. She just looks at me, says “what?” again, so I repeat myself louder. Then she starts laughing and says, “Yes! I got three swear words now!”",MaliciousCompliance,1627842902,kwnofprocrastination,0,1,self-post

2021-08-01 11:42:21,"$50,000 collector car is an ""eyesore"" to HOA","Okay, so i've been dealing with this for the last three months and it has FINALLY reached it's climax. for a little back story; I own a towing company and am currently renting a home within an HOA i was NOT informed of when i signed the lease. My wife and i broke ground on our dream home days before lockdown went into effect last year. we signed a two year lease as we were offered a $250 reduction in rent if we did. the house has a three car garage attached to it, as well as parking for an additional two cars in the driveway. i keep my tow truck in the driveway or parked on the street in front of the house as it is classified as an ""emergency vehicle"" by the state and not merely a commercial vehicle. this means it is not against the HOA to have it in the neighborhood. we also own many cars as all three people living in the home are car nuts. now we do not keep that all at the home but we do have a total of 6 cars at the home, plus the tow truck which means two vehicles are always parked on the street. for reference the cars we keep at the home are 1. 1967 4 door Chevy Impala, 2. 1967 Ford Galaxie, 3. 1993 Mazda Rx-7, 4. 1994 Nissan Silvia, 5. 2013 Subaru BRZ, 6. 2008 BMW M3. of these cars all of the imports have wide body kits that cost between 4 and 12 grand. (this is important as to value of vehicles as well as looks.) look up rocket bunny and liberty walk to get an idea of what they look like.  


okay now for the story, after living here for just over 9 months and as the lockdowns were ending/the world opened it's weary eyes just to get punched in the face again the HOA that we had absolutely no idea existed started by ticketing the tow truck which is parked on the street stating that it cannot be parked on the street. okay, i'll put it in the driveway no problem. pay the $150 fine to the HOA after getting the contract from the landlord and reading it, i figure it's best to just go along with it and not ruffle any feathers. by moving the tow truck into the driveway i started parking the RX7 on the streets. here is a  [photo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/fb/ec/19fbec9ed8a80677bf4eb757c826a05c.jpg) of what the car looks like from the company page. (now the reason i listed the other cars) the two classic cars are kept in the garage, as well as the BRZ as it is my project car and i'm in the middle of building a very high end drift car out of it. the other two people in my house drive the BMW and Nissan every day.)  


the very next day i return home and there are tickets on both the RX7 and the Silvia which are parked on the street by our driveway, numerous neighbors are also parked on the street mind you without tickets from the HOA. i immediately call the a-hole in ""charge"" of the HOA to ask what the hell is going on. AH (a-hole) tells me that our ""junk"" is devaluing the neighborhood and cannot be parked on the streets and cites a rule in the HOA guidelines about vehicles being in disrepair or essentially a junk status needing to be put in a garage. i laughed, full on gut chuckle. the guy i'm talking to drives an early 2000's Cadillac that may be worth 10k. AH tells me that if the vehicles continue to be parked on the street he will have them towed.  okay lets play, i told AH that he needs to read his own manual and look at the vehicles he is talking about which for reference here is an image of a matching [Silvia](https://i.redd.it/zd7n6yxirpl51.jpg) which is also parked on the street. clearly both cars  are not in disarray.  


AH 10 days after the intial ticketing calls for a tow truck and this is where i should mention that the reason my tow truck is listed as an emergency vehicle is because my company has the county police contract for their towing, as well as the township. when small-guy towing (SG) shows up to impound my vehicles i am not home, i get a call from SG that he has been sent to impound my cars. (we know each other from the businesses we operate and i often kick him work when we are holding over a 90 minute ETA to not upset customers.)  


SG tells me that he HAS to tow my cars due to his contract with the HOA but he doesn't have a truck that can tow these lowered cars without damaging them. SG asks me to come home and remove the bumpers so they will go on his truck. i told SG that it wasn't going to happen and i'd hate to look for other-guy towing to send overflow work to while we see how the courts feel about the impounding and potential damages to the cars. SG wisely decides to not tow the vehicles. now this was October of 2020. since then SG has called me dozens of times about AH calling him repeatedly to tow the vehicles, SG telling AH that the only company in the area that can tow these vehicles is my company. FINALLY on july 5th AH calls my company to impound MY cars. okay, no problem. i sent 3 of my guys over in the shop pickup to drive my cars back to the shop where they were parked and kept for the last month. the wife started driving the Impala regularly as it is summer.  


Friday we went to small claims court as i sued the HOA for towing costs $250 per vehicle as well as storage on each vehicle $62 per day each AND an additional $3,000 for inconveniences due to not having the cars for daily transportation. add on an additional $1500 for lawyer fees. after roughly five minutes the judge asks for photos from AH of the cars, AH gives the judge photos. the judge comments on how nice the cars are and they clearly are not in disarry. i thank the judge and ask him if he can see the Cadillac parked on the street way in the background of the photo, as well as the other 5 or 6 cars in frame. the judge affirms this and asks AH about these cars. AH states that they are NOT in violation and even coughs up that the Cadillac is his car.   


the judge smiles a toothy grin and confesses to being a car guy and estimates that each of the two cars that have been impounded are worth 50k each and that AH's Cadillac would clearly be the eyesore of the community. the judge then dismisses the HOA's claims and explicitly tells AH that he is NOT to tow any vehicles out of the neighborhood without police confirmation of their disarray or abandonment. judges goes further and states that the HOA is in violation of the township ordinance as the streets are NOT private streets but belong to the township. the judge then grabs what i assume is a calculator and starts punching away. after about a minute and a half of pure silence the judge looks up and says ""okay, as stated before AH's claim for the HOA has been dismissed, as for u/whipssolo's counter suit i will rule in favor in the amount of $10,100 and $65.50 in court costs to AH's HOA. AH lost his freaking mind. AH went on a rant about communism? and how the judge was the problem with this country and into election conspiracies and every wackjob theory you'd hear from people like Alex Jones. the judge warned AH twice and finally ordered him in contempt and invited him to have a weekend stay on the counties dime at the local jail. AH will be home tonight as the judge set to release him at 6pm. the cars are back in their original spots and i cannot wait for the hand wave and grin as AH comes home this evening.

2021-08-01 10:31:39,I don't want to.,"So... not exactly Malicious but certainly rigorous compliance.  


I was bout five and was taking piano lessons, i was actually quite enjoying it but hated practicing certain pieces i found rather boring so my piano teacher came up with a wonderful system; Once I could play a piece perfectly (to her satisfaction) I would get a gold star in my book and I would \*never\* have to play the piece again unless ""I wanted to"" (her words) so there was one particular piece I absolutely hated that she knew i was bad at that she made me play pretty much every lesson.  
So; I sat down and I practiced it and i practiced it and I practiced it, until i could play it perfectly, I went back in, played it for her, got my gold star. Felt really proud of what i'd achieved and that i never had to play that awful piece again.  


Guess what happened the very next session?   


She asked me to play the dreaded piece. I refused, she asked why and i told her that she'd said that I never had to play that piece again unless I wanted to and \*I didn't want to.\* She said i was going to sit at that piano until I played it, i told her my mum would be there to pick me up in 10 minutes and i could wait. When my mum got there my teacher called me a rude disrespectful little boy and said she was never teaching me ever again.

&gt;
Every night I did the 'late list', calling people with overdue movies and games.
&gt;
If they didn't answer the phone I was to always leave voicemail.
&gt;
&gt;What frequently occurred after doing the late list was...
&gt;
*Ring ring*
&gt;
[Video store] this is Nutsaur.""
&gt;
*Click*

*#GRR!*

This happened multiple times every single night.

See, it costs to check a voicemail so I'll just return the call and find out who it was.
&gt;
Why pay to check your voicemail when you could ring back a missed call for free?
&gt;
I don't know if it still costs to check your own voicemail but it did back then. 

That same year I disabled my voicemail for that very reason. Pay to check my own messages? No thanks!
&gt;
But I digress...
&gt;
So I thought okay i'll just answer politely without the company name and maybe they'll stop hanging up on me?
&gt;
Good evening, this is Nutsaur.""
&gt;
""...hello? Who is this?""
&gt;
""This is Nutsaur.""
&gt;
Oh did you call me?""
&gt;
""Yeah I work at [video store] and you've got an overdue rental...""
&gt;

Until...
&gt;
&gt;""Good evening, this is Nutsaur""
&gt;
""Heeey, Nutsaur. This is [boss]. Uh, make sure you're using the company name when you answer the phone, okay?""
&gt;
Damn. Okay that's a hurdle. I hate answering the phone and being hung up on but my boss will catch me if I only say my name.
&gt;

So how do I stop hang ups but also comply?

You know how annoying it is when you miss a call from a private number? It's annoying because I don't know who it was and I can't call them back...that's it!
&gt;
Time to stare into the abyss!
&gt;
I looked up that I only had to dial four numbers on our landline before calling someone to block our number.
&gt;
Nobody would know who is calling them until they answered or checked the message but technically I was still doing my job.
&gt;
If someone missed the call their cellphone would say 'One missed call from private number - one new voicemail.'
&gt;
Would my boss have approved? Absolutely not. 

If he ever found out he would have told me to stop because lots of people don't answer private numbers.

If they didn't take the call or check the voicemail they didn't get the reminder but I *had* called and left a message so technically I had completed my task.

This way the late list got done, I answered the phone properly, and nobody called and hung up on me ever again.",MaliciousCompliance,1627826233,nutsaur,0,1,self-post

2021-08-01 00:21:24,"""Personal responsibility""? Ok!","I've been doing all my shopping online, from groceries to clothes everything which means I usually get a lot of deliveries. I also buy a lot of stuff for my family to use, esp when groceries and basic necessities. I started buying from more small local businesses, it being the pandemic and me wanting to help them more instead of big businesses like Amazon. This has meant having to deal with incredibly vague (or straight up wrong) delivery information, I've worked at a small business before so I expected these problems and don't mind it.

Cue few weeks ago. Mom doesn't work anymore, sis is on term break, and I am working from home having a meeting. A delivery comes and no one answers the door, I have my headphones on so i can't hear the bell. The deliveryman calls me and tells me he has been ringing the door and no one is answering even though he can hear the TV. I apologise and run out to collect the parcel, see my mom in front of the tele with so much indifference. This makes me mildly annoyed and I asked her nicely to help open the door next time. Immediately she screams at me for ""assuming she has nothing to do"" which sets off this shouting match between her and I. My sister comes out of her room, takes my mother's side and shouts at me for ""being rude"" just for expecting my mother to answer the door. 

At this point I'm livid and i ask if it's too much to expect my own family to help with these things, esp when im working. They both go on about how it's my ""personal responsibility"" to collect my own deliveries and that i should not ""take for granted"" that they'll help just because they're at home. And that i should tell them when i have deliveries coming, to which i try to explain about the often vague delivery estimates i get (this one in particular was suppose to come 2 days later). 

I point out to them that most of the deliveries that come for me end up being shared by the family (ie the groceries, coffee, necessities etc) and that at the start of the year, before my mom quit her job, i was working from home alone collecting everyone's deliveries even when no one tells me about any incoming ones. I singled out one day my sister had 4 deliveries and i collected them all with no complaints. But obviously none of it gets through to them and I give up the arguement since i was out numbered. 

Bring on the MC. I stopped ordering groceries for the whole family and food runs out, both mom and sis just assume that I would order more and when I don't they question me about it and i tell them that it's their own ""personal responsibility"" to get their own groceries. 

A couple of deliveries came for my sister when she wasn't home and I didn't bother receiving it because the ""personal responsibility"" was hers to collect. Plus, she didn't tell anyone about them. Turns out one of those deliveries was a laptop and because no one answered the door, it was left outside and got stolen. My sister got (rightfully) angry at me and my mother but i used their bullshit ""personal responsibility"" excuse back on her.

Now no one is talking to each other but I don't care, i feel like I've willingly and readily helped them but when i ask for help in return it's way too much for them to do so.

One of our technical staff, I will call him K, was extremely skilled and reliable but often argumentative and surly. I think he had a right to be, considering his workload and relatively poor wages.

One day a particularly unpleasant member of middle management decided to boss him around and give him extra jobs that he had no right to. In fact, K was not even a member of his department, just an adjacent one that often did overlapping work. After a heated argument the manager loudly fired K in front of all present and told him he would have him escorted from the building if he didn't leave immediately and never come back.

K took this about as well as can be expected and shouted back that the manager had no authority over his department, this would have to be approved by higher ups or at least the manager of Ks own department to be legally binding. The manager repeated his threat and K left the building on his own accord.

Flash forward to a little under a year later and all of Ks duties have been assigned to other people by the middle manager who fired him, increasing people's workload even further. There is talk of union action and work stoppages, union reps have raised a legal fund to sue the company for various infringements against the technical staff. Somehow they are still over budget, despite not having made any new hires.

That's when the manager gets a very unpleasant phone call from his boss, asking if it is true that he told K to never come back to work all those months before. The manager says he did and asks what the problem is. Turns out K was absolutely right and the manager never had any authority to fire him. In fact K had been showing up for work every single day for close to a year only to punch himself into work and then returned at the end of the day to punch out, never entering the building but maintaining his hours and getting receiving full pay.

The manager had apparently sent one informal e-mail to accounting to tell them K was fired but never responded when the accountant asked for confirmation from the relevant department or higher ups. Thus K was still legally employed by the company and received all his pay and benefits for nearly a year while being absent.

That particular manager didn't interact much with staff after that, probably by order.",MaliciousCompliance,1627798365,MorrisonsLament,0,1,self-post

He’d drunk a little under half and was just sipping at it, and I said to him, “ok little man, one more sip then it’s going in the fridge and you’re going for quiet time”

He looks me dead in the eye then fully tries to neck the rest of the bottle!

My parents where ok with with us being in my room (second story, at the end of the hall) but they had a rule where we couldn't be on the bed together. I'm not taking the line was under a blanket together, we couldn't even sit with our back against the wall (short side of the bed) next to each other, one person on the bed and the other on the floor. I will note they had no issues with us sitting close to each other in the living room, even with some cuddling or me putting my legs across his lap. I will also add that they had no problem going to bed and letting him leave very late/early hours of the morning, he just couldn't stay over. 

After a few times getting in trouble and being told strictly, we were not allow to be on a bed together in anyway, I mentioned that they were ok with us sitting on the couch, and they said it was different.  

Que Malicious Compliance.

So I took a trip down to my local goodwill and found a really nice double reclining loveseat for $35 . We hauled that heavy mother fucker up the stairs and in to my bedroom, giving me about 2ft of room between my bed and the couch.

2021-07-31 19:28:18,"“Don’t come back here until you can afford passage!”? Okay, but we’ll be back sooner than you think.","A lot of this story has been passed down and translated across Italian to English, to whatever version of that my mom speaks, so forgive me ahead of time for any formatting and “lost in translation” moments. Love you Ma.

This is about my great grandparents, Mario and Maria, and their young son Pasquale as they attempt to come to America. My great grandfather and grandmother had been falling on hard times in the early 1900s in Italy, and have been trying for close to two years now to attempt to get tickets to board a ship, any ship, a shoebox, that could get them to America. It wasn’t exactly their lifelong dream, but when Maria got pregnant they made the decision that they needed to go to “freedom”. 

After trying everything, in early 1912 Mario finally decides to just go to the shipyard in gatinava Italy to see what he can drum up. He was hoping to get a ticket by any means possible. The area was absolutely bustling with many people boarding ships, looking around some smiling, some crying. 

He was a very talented carpenter and wanted to see if he could build something for someone. He was even looking on the ground to see if someone dropped a ticket. He was desperate. He finally decides to offer his services or to work on the boat to someone looking like they are an important person about the shipyard. The man turning around, says “You dirty man , I see you running around our ships all day, get out of here!! Don’t come back until you can afford passage!!”

Enter malicious compliance.

As angry as Mario was at this man, he didn’t want to anger the only one (in his eyes at the time) that could stop him from boarding besides money. He went back home, tail between his legs, and kept plugging away in his hometown of somewhere, Northern Italy.

Fast forward to late April, 1912. The titanic sank, the demand for traveling by ship has diminished significantly. He gets tickets for all three to board for like a tenth of the price, and affordable finally. He never saw the guy who insulted him, but he sure was looking as he boarded the ship in a much much less bustling area. 

America, here we come!

I took a little Pepto last night to try and make sure I would sleep through the night, but woke up feeling like shit. 

I knew my work would scramble to cover my shift (customer service) if I called in, and I needed the money, so I called ahead and said ""Hey, I'm feeling kinda sick still, if you guys could keep me mostly at the desk today I'd appreciate it cause idk how my stomach is going to handle things like bagging."" direct supervisor said no problem, but within a few minutes her boss called me up and told me I couldn't just pick and choose where to work for the day, that if I was feeling sick I had to either call out or work any position they needed me in. After like 20 minutes of having a go-around with three different managers, I told them I was going to just call in and go to the urgent care to figure out what was wrong. 

Went in, told the doc what had been going on, and he diagnosed me with viral gastroenteritis, which is a fancy way of saying I have stomach flu. I asked if I should be fine to go back to work, and he told me that the EARLIEST I should go back is Monday, and wrote me a note. With all that in mind, I walked my happy ass from the doctor to my work (like 2-3 miles?) masked up to pick up my prescription, handed them my doctor's note for them to make a photocopy of, grabbed some sick supplies like chicken soup, saltines and applesauce, and grinned under my mask while I heard them scrambling to find someone to cover my shift tomorrow while I walked away.",MaliciousCompliance,1627769674,lepelael,0,1,self-post

2021-07-31 12:29:57,The man we called Subsection 6,"This happened long time ago somewhere around 2012-2013.

Had a good friend who I smoke cigars with and he had a friend named Jim. I didn't see Jim very often cuz we lived in different cities but every time I visited we would smoke cigars in the park.

Well, near the park.

Jim was probably about the smartest guy that I've ever met and if I met Einstein it might be eenie meenie miney moe. Well, almost.

We called him Subsection 6 because he was always finding loopholes for absolutely everything. He's the kind of guy that would read all the tax laws and interpretation bulletins and mold his life to that. He was the one of the first people that was working from home. He had his printer in a different room than where he had his office so that he could claim more square footage as the home office. He was that kind of guy.  And he wasn't an accountant or anything. He was an IT guy. He just read lots. 

One day the three of us went down to the beach to smoke cigars. In parks you're not allowed to smoke but we grabbed our chairs and went anyways. The tide was low so we went down just past the rocks where the sand started and smoked away. That's where I heard this story.

So remember Einstein told a story about if he had one hour to solve a problem to save his life he would think of the proper question for 58 minutes?

Well Jim's one of those kind of guys that ask questions that we don't think about. He looked around the park because he was busted one time and he asked himself this question. I can see the property line where the road is, I can see the property line where there's a house next door and he can see the property line where there was a hotel next. But where is the property line when you're looking out at the ocean?  

He did his homework and he found out that while the city owned the foreshore, it was DFO that owns the ocean from the high tide line down. That is crown land and they don't have a prohibition for smoking on the ocean. That is where we had our chairs the day he told me the story.

So he lives in a retirement city with lots of old ladies who have their morning walks the same time he has his morning cigar. That's how he got busted in the first place but he was ready after he did his research. He used that printer that was in the other room and he printed out the laws. He also made a phone call to one of his cigar buddies who was a lawyer who knew a lawyer that did property stuff. I'm not talking about real estate transactions when you buy a house I'm talking about property rights, air rights, things like that. A lot higher up in the food chain. Top floor corner office kind of guy.

So depending on cigar you're looking at 45 minutes to smoke a robusto to an hour and a half for a Churchill or anything bigger than that. Soon thereafter the Karens came by complaining about him smoking in the park even though he was in the ocean. This was even years before anyone was called Karen!

So the Karens started bugging him and threatened to call police or bylaw and he told them to go ahead. He just started his cigar so he had plenty of time. He sent a message to his lawyer friend of a friend to give him a heads up he might be calling later. No problem.

Well the Karen's didn't just call bylaw they called the police.  So Jim continued smoking a cigar while he handed over the printout regarding foreshore ownership. It's not fault of the police because they're used to speeding and stuff like that but they didn't know this law.

Bylaw comes by and pretty much the same so he gets on his phone shows them the lawyers website, and makes the call.  Meanwhile the cops and bylaw are phoning their supervisors about this as well.

Of course the Karens are not happy so they start complaining about the second hand smoke but they don't have any legal basis. 

Jim talks to the property rights lawyer on speakerphone and he says for the police and bylaw supervisors to give him a shout and he will enlighten them about where park property begin and end.

And of course the best part of the story is that we were smoking a 10 year old Punch Churchill when he told me the story. 

So the epilogue is that whenever he's smoking at low tide and bylaw comes by (not just for him but for dogs and drinking and other stuff like that) they always shake their head and wave. They told him they've had complaints about him smoking in the park and they now ask where is the guy? In the park or down on the sand? 

Because the sand isn't park. It's the ocean.",MaliciousCompliance,1627756197,RecommendationNo191,0,1,self-post

We were at a favorite restaurant, and the restaurant had Captain's Wafer crackers, which I adore.

I was munching happily, when I received an admonishment from my mother.

""Do not eat that whole cracker,"" or some semblance thereof.

If you know the cracker, there are several rows of perforations, assumably to facilitate cooking.  They are spaced about 1/8"" apart along the length of the cracker.

I took a knife, cut the cracker on one of the ends.   Thusly, I removed a minuscule portion at the perforation row and met my mother's requirements.  I gleefully ate the remainder.

2021-07-31 06:59:56,"But Captain, that's no woman","I used to work as an officer in the merchant navy a few years ago.
Life at sea is hard on the crew, some of my colleagues from over countries had six months of rotation, at best. So to say that they miss their families is an understatement. Since we were an all-male crew, most missed woman as well.

The company that I worked for had renewed the policy regarding sexual harrassment, on of the rules was that no pornographic pictures (bikini pictures in this case) were allowed to be on display in the common areas, or anything might be offensive for that sake. As the policy said: ""No sexual display of woman"", or domething along that line..
Fair enough, the crew were ok with this and all offensive pictures were removed.

A week later on we had a ship meeting in the mess, the Captain then questions the crew, as to why the picture of the barely dressed woman was removed in the computer room, only to be replaced with another picture of a woman in an itsy-bitsy bikini.

All of the crewmen smirked, one of them looked the captain dead in they eyes with a big smile and said: ""But Captain, that's no woman"".

I show up to a night shift in observation unit \[I don't know if that's the correct English term\], when two odd looking Hassidic men almost jump at me, frantically asking ""Are you the night shift nurses? Are you the nightshift nurse?"".

I reply ""No"", and they look disappointed, before going back to room 11. I make eye contact with the evening shift nurse \[who was sitting by the computer, unbothered\], confused, and ask what this was all about.

She explains that the patient in room 11 is the leader of a locally infamous cult, known for being extremely misogynistic, among other things. It happened so that the leader in question also has cancer, and requires blood transfusions. Which he refused to do in the outpatient unit, when offered to him, because literally every single professional there is a woman. So he went to the observation unit instead.

Apparently, he refuses to have any woman touch him or go into the room he's in - he threw a fit when the nurse attempted to just place the transfusion stand in the room. He probably expected that, considering his religious affiliation and status, he'll get a special treatment and get a male nurse or a doctor called from the ER. But the head nurse, when called, instructed not to do that.

So once his refusal was properly documented, then, the nurse showed his two deciples\[?\] the bag, and informed them that the treatment was there, and if they want, they can sign a waiver of liability and administer it themselves. They did. 

The nurse gave them instructions, and informed them that ""I'm right here if you need me for anything""... Then watched them fumble for hours, with the leader yelling at them for being clueless idiots.

We had a pretty huge selection of candies to choose from, including a pay-per-pound candy case that took up most of the store. We sold a decent amount of licorice in different flavors, including salted licorice. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s just black licorice that’s been dusted with powdered salt. We had a few different versions of it, but one stood out for how *damn salty it was.* Seawater is less salty than that licorice. Pure salt is somehow less salty than that licorice. We would always have new employees eat a piece of it as “initiation,” and share a few laughs at their facial expressions after the first bite.

One day an older man comes in and rudely asks where our salted licorice is. I guide him over to the licorice section, and show him the choices we have. He immediately goes for the saltier-than-salt licorice coins. I try my best to dissuade him, explaining that this licorice is extremely salty, but he quickly turns on me.

“Young u/yellowspaces, I’ve been eating salted licorice my entire life. Just shut the hell up and weigh me out a pound so I can get the hell out of your damn store.” 

Cue the malicious compliance! I gladly weigh him up a pound of the salt coins, and take him over to the register. I ring up his devil “candy,” hand him a receipt, and take a step back. Old man starts walking to the door, but luckily takes a piece and pops it in his mouth before leaving. 

“OH MY F****** GOD. WHAT IN THE HELL IS THIS!?!?” he screams after a few chews. The store is now dead silent. He storms back up the register and starts screaming at me. 

“THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST LICORICE I’VE HAD IN MY LIFE! HOW DARE YOU LET ME BUY THIS! GET YOUR F****** MANAGER RIGHT NOW, YOU DESERVE TO BE FIRED FOR SELLING ME THIS!!!” 

Before I can even say a word, my manager quickly comes up to me and motions me aside. 

“Sir, I was listening to your transaction, and u/yellowspaces made multiple attempts to talk you out of your selection. Normally I’d be more than happy to issue you a refund, but considering your language and treatment of my employees, *I’m going to need you to get the hell out and never come back.*”

2021-07-30 19:00:25,Kill 'em with kindness,"Back in 2019, I started working remotely for an international architecture firm as the project and sales manager. We create architectural renderings, animations,  VR walk-throughs, you name it. Our clients come from all over the world and I manage the North American branch of the company. Our US team is small and comprised of myself and two other women also with backgrounds in architecture. We're lucky to work with a team that is very inclusive and supportive and our clients are great 99% of the time. 

A few months into my new position, we get a phone call from an American developer requesting a rendering package. A team member from our Euro branch answers first and within ten seconds transfers the call to our US team, as per company policy. I answer the phone.

""Hi, you've reached [Our Company], how can we help you?"" 

The caller immediately sounds annoyed, but mumbles: ""I want a drawing done, of a building I'm making."" I respond in my cheerful customer service voice™, ""Sure thing, we can help you with that!"", and I begin listing the design files we will need from him to create a 3D render. He cuts me off a few seconds in, ""You don't know what you're talking about!""

It's not uncommon to deal with annoyed clients. Most people are stressed out with tight deadlines of their own, so I try to be as patient and helpful as possible. I ask the caller, ""Will you please describe your project in detail? That way we can create the best design package for your-"" 
He cuts me off yet again. ""I want to speak to the manager! You have no idea what you're doing!! I want to talk to the MAN who answered the phone.""

At this point I figure out what is going on. I politely explain to him that I am the manager for American projects and the man he briefly spoke with works with our Euro branch, but the caller is just not having it. He yells into the phone: ""I want to speak to an AMERICAN!"" Thank god for volume controls on headsets.

Taking a huge breath, I plaster a smile across my face and explain again in a syrupy sweet tone, ""I completely understand sir, I am the manager for our American branch. I can help you with your project."" My motto is kill 'em with kindness. 

He explodes: ""The man I talked to understood my entire project! You know nothing!"" So begins the death spiral. I decide to agree to everything he says.

*Caller*: ""I want to speak to someone else!""
Me: ""Sure thing! I'll transfer you to our Euro department.""
*Caller*: ""NO. I want to speak to an American!""
Me: ""You got it! How can I help you?""
*Caller*: ""Fine! I want to speak to YOUR boss!""
Me: ""Sure thing! He's in the Euro department, I'll transfer you now.""

I transfer the call to my bosses' office and wait for the inevitable. After a few seconds, my phone rings again with a transfer request. I answer with a grin, ""Hi, you've reached [Our Company], how can we help you?"" 

Dead silence on the line. Then our dear caller huffs ""Fine! I'll call back tomorrow then!""

I cheerfully bid him farewell, ""Okay sounds great, I'll speak to you then!""

2021-07-30 17:39:20,"Remember, Report Weird Things To The Boss!","Me again, feeling the need to rant about past jobs!

Obligatory disclaimer: this story is old, and I've not worked there for a VERY long time.  If the people in this post recognize the situation, well, it's your own damn fault.

Having gotten that out of the way, to the story!

Fresh out of college, and into the first post-college job.  Now, some of us are very lucky and get to work in a field close to, or in, our chosen realm of expertise right out of college.  I was not one of those lucky people, so I got to work for a popular rental company for a while.  You don't need to know which one.  They're all similarly terrible.

I was given the requisite training (not much), and left to the tender guardianship of someone who'd been there for a few years (ie, work senior).  At first, I thought everything was fine.  Why wouldn't it be fine?  The gal and I seemed to get along well, and the job, while not fun or glamorous, paid me enough for the absolute bare minimum living expenses.  Good thing I was still on the family insurance at the time, because the job, after an attempt or two, refused to hire me full-time so I could get my own insurance.

Anyway.

Like I said, at FIRST, I thought things were fine.  The person who was guiding me gradually started treating me poorly.  I chalked it up to ongoing situations with her private life (she was pregnant, living situation stuff, etc), but as time went on, she kept snubbing me and some others, and wouldn't answer questions.  My last attempt, she just told me, ""look, I don't wanna have to answer your questions anymore.  Just report anything wrong you see to the boss.""

I'm sure you can all see where this is going.

Found out from the boss, that I was getting reported as not working, when I actually was.  I luckily always had witnesses to the fact that I was, in fact, working as hard as I had to be, so nothing really came of it.  *(as an aside, I later learned it had been* ***her*** *starting the rumors of my not being a good worker.  Still don't know why.  I was never anything but pleasant to her)*

In my relative naiveté, I noticed that she was taking a lot more breaks than she was technically allowed, even considering she did have special dispensation because, y'know, pregnant.  More, she started disappearing from the job entirely at strange times, reappearing looking completely innocent and fresh.  Almost like she'd not been working.  Her partner would bring the car around, and she'd take the time to give it a loving wash (which was sometimes allowed).

Thinking it strange, I did what she told me to do.  I reported it to the boss.  I named times, and that I'd seen her partner's car in the bay.  Since I sometimes borrowed my roommate's car, I asked, could I also use the bay to wash it?  Boss looked confused, but said I could wash the car if I wanted and we weren't busy.

Turns out that my (and I later found out, others) reporting her, and giving times, made the boss decide to check the security cameras.  She and her partner had, among other things, been stealing fuel and other things from the job, and her ass got canned on the relative spot.

2021-07-30 14:23:50,Tell me to host the wedding party? Ok.,"My friend Mabel is getting married but her party venue was closed down due to a water main burst. Her wedding is in three months but she was super desperate so she begged and begged and kept begging so I finally said yes. She wanted the wedding at my chairy farm. I have three farms: a chairy farm, a root farm (onions, beets, tomatoes, etc.), and a miscellaneous one for things like strawberries and carrots and stuff. Two of them are in green houses because of the climate and she wants to have her venue in one of them. I said sure not problem, because I can easily move the trees out of the green house since they usually get stored in my garage during off season. She surprised showed up at my house asking to see the greenhouse but I told her that I can show her but the the chairy trees have thorns and stuff so I told her to be really careful. (I’ve been stuck so bad I’ve had to go to the doctors office because of a tetanus infection from the wound being infected) loe and behold she walks right into one of the fucking tree branches and I have to take her to the hospital because she is allergic to cherries (why would she want to have her venue in the cherry greeenhouse anyways I ask myself??) I got mad at her and told her how upset I was because I felt bad she had a reaction. She was so upset she demanded it be in the greenhouse. To be fare it is in a really scenic area. Here is where the malicious compliance happens:

It is the wedding day so I cart the chairy trees out of the greenhouse but my garage is packed with wedding tables and the cake so I’m like. I can’t put these trees in here so where am I going to put them? So I just decided to have a cherry tree section in the corner of the greenhouse and I bungee corded the branches together so it took up less space. We had the wedding and it was a blast and every one was so happy and I even let people eat the cherries but they weren’t ripe so it was gross but people liked the experience.

2021-07-30 13:53:12,Don’t want this saleswoman? Let me find another for you.,"While I was putting myself through university (this was in the mid 2000s), I was working at a bicycle shop. I can honestly say it’s the best place I have ever worked; the owners treated their staff very well and so this shop retained loyal, highly-capable employees that made loads of high-end sales. But what was somewhat unusual (for a male-dominated industry in the mid 2000s) was that there was an equal number of male and female employees. And these women were definitely the most qualified people for the job. One was an engineer for a bike company, one was a highly successful triathlete and XC racer, and even one of the owners was a woman. *Almost* having an unrelated university degree meant that I was BY FAR the least impressive woman working at this place. I just liked bikes.

One day, a man (maybe 50-60ish) came in to the shop. I was first on the scene. He said he was looking to buy a bike and so I started going through the usual probing questions to determine what kind of bike he was looking for. Simple questions like: did he ride on the road or trails? Even the most incapable salesperson could use the answers to these questions to point this guy in the right direction. But he seemed HIGHLY resistant to talking to me or answering my questions. He finally said, “is there someone else I could talk to?” 

Maybe he just didn’t like my sales approach or maybe I seemed too young to be knowledgeable. But since he didn’t even give me a chance to prove myself, and seemed to be staring longingly at my busy male colleagues, I had a hunch that he didn’t think a woman was capable of selling him a bike. So I smiled and said, “of course!” Lucky for me, there weren’t any idle male employees in sight. So I grabbed one of the other women that I worked with, quietly letting her know my suspicions about this guy. Before I was even out of earshot, I hear this man agitatedly say, “I need someone ELSE”. Suspicions CONFIRMED. So we purposely seek out yet another extremely capable female employee to help this man. When he sees her approach, he shouts, “JUST LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!!!!” 

So in struts the owner, who is *very* eager to join our malicious compliance stunt, with a beaming smile on HER face. “I’m the owner. What can I do to help you today, sir?” The utter defeat on his face is something I will never forget.",MaliciousCompliance,1627674792,BreWanKenobi,790,1,self-post

So, since I adopted my kid she's been having lots and lots of friends come around and of course that means I am getting to meet the parents. So far I have met 5 of Ks Friends Parents most of which have been Lovely people and one I absolutely hate there was another set of parents that we got off on the wrong foot (accidental racisms from them) and I recently had we will say umm ""pleasure"" of meeting Ks friend Ashly's father Her parents are

well Yah lets get on with Bunny story time.

K had her friend Ashly over for the night and it makes me happy K has really opened up in the last few months and is growing into the confident friendly Bubbly Joyful person

Well the day after I didn't know it was Ashly's fathers day with her so he came to my house to pick her up. The girls weren't ready to leave yet they still had to pick As clothing up and pack so instead of making the father wait out in his car I told them that they will still be a few min and he's welcome to come inside and wait.

I went ahead and tried to make the usual small talk, but was instantly getting the creeper vibes off this guy mostly because the line of questioning and phrasing he was giving and using. it was allot of do you live here alone all by your self this is a terribly big place for such a small little girl (referring to me as a little girl) or (Oh, I should come to visit you sometime your place can use a mans touch) he basically treated my house as if it was his and just creeped on me big time.

Well, this guy decided to literally tell me that oh go make me a sandwich for the road, he didn't say hey, I haven't had anything to eat yet was not polite at all the assholes demanded food from a stranger he just met while waiting for his kid.

I thought he was making a bad joke I said my English is not that good are you making a joke and he flat out said no I am hungry, go grab me a sandwich doll at this point I am pissed off this literally is the most mysognistic man I have ever met in my life and I was pissed off Did I say I was pissed off because I was pissed off like PISSED

so I did it I put on my friendly submissive Asian lady smile and said ok Sir.

and i went to the kitchen got out some really good roast beef (it was from dinner a few days ago) and really nice French bread and made him a nice sandwich.

I did add a healthy amount of ground Szechuan Peppercorns a nice glob of Ghost pepper extract sauce (I use it for making super spicy chili) white pepper and a fine spread of minced scotch bonnet peppers.

packed it in a baggy and lucky the girls were ready to go as I packed the sandwich

I handed it to him with a big smile and have a NICE day SIR as he walked out the door.

I did immediately tell K to text her friend to not eat the sandwich and told her what was happening.

later that day Ashly called K to say what did you do to my dad (she was cry laughing on the call)

Edit: just for an FYI this was weapons grade spicy and it was a smoked brisket. I used the juice from the brisket I saved to hide allot of the spicy smell",MaliciousCompliance,1627674459,No-Cartoonist-2079,1,1,self-post

2021-07-30 13:25:54,Jeans are against the dress code now?,"Like many stories I've read here I'm not entirely sure if this belongs here either but figured it's a story worth telling anyway.

So this happened more than a few years ago at a premium retailer I used to work for. The stores were locally owned and the atmosphere was casual but professional- this included being allowed to wear jeans. We had about 6 stores around town and I was in the position of support bouncing around from store to store. 
I also never sold anything my customers didn't need. The owner didn't care because I was there to support his stores and my quality was really high but eventually he was forced to sell to a much larger chain and the new guys were known to have strict sales quotas. So you can see my not selling crap was a huge no no. 

Now the MC: the new guys forced me into a store and cut off the bouncing around, they also changed our dress code to wear slacks instead of jeans and trained us on our new (their) corporate policies. Most of us were fine with this but I wasn't, we live in a very hot climate and jeans are much more comfortable. The new district manager started noticing I wasn't meeting my sales quotas which my store Manager knew. He pointed out my metrics were still high but the new boss didn't care because I wasn't peddling his crap. They decided to invectivize us with a sales contest, winner gets to wear jeans again that following Friday, we just had to meet the sales quota. My manager knew I would refuse but chose to play along anyway to please the dm. 

That following Friday I walked in wearing jeans. My manager knew why but just shook his head and laughed to himself. When the DM decided to grace us with his presence later that day he saw me in jeans then went into the back to check the numbers. He went ballistic and called me into the back. He berated me for not following policy and daring to wear jeans when I didn't meet the sales quota, blah blah blah. I just smiled which really pissed him off then happily pointed to the calendar and their policy: it was Halloween and I was allowed to dress up however I fucking pleased. He turned red but couldn't refute this fact. My manager was at the front listening to every word trying not to laugh (he didn't like the new bosses anymore than the rest of us) and the rest of my team got a real kick out of my non compliance after the DM left. 

That guy turned out to be even more if a dick than I originally thought and ended up harassing us into quitting a few months later, fortunately I already had a new job lined up. Still, fuck petty managers and their power trips.",MaliciousCompliance,1627673154,Able_Engine_9515,24,1,self-post

The so-called head of the project whom I do not answer directly to but who has started to order me around reviewed our dratf of report and she had so many complaints about it even though it was done almost perfectly by our team.

She started to criticize our very much detailed description on everything (which usually will get you  higher marks with the panel juries, she's not one of them) and one of her comments was 'you're showing too much cooperation and team work', 'we don't need to see the step-by-step' and 'it's too comprehensive' and 'take out all of these things and make it simpler'.

Since we don't need to show that we're doing honest work, I am starting to Photoshop everything just to show the end result.

2021-07-30 09:16:05,You want me to check if your new BS policies are legal? Sure!,"About 10 years ago I had my first real job working in a fast food chain for minimum wage. It was a shitty job but it was only to fill a gap between me dropping out of 6th form in Feb and starting my college course in Sep.

After being there several months, the regional manager came over to visit and said about there being a few incidents regarding money missing from the tills that were never resolved. We're not exactly talking about the heist of the century here, it would be a few pence or at most £5 out and this had only happened on a handful of occasions. Most were resolved to being mistaken orders on the tills or card receipts dropping behind the tills. Because of this, there was a new policy that they implemented where the staff members would each be personally responsible for their tills, meaning they required everybody to come in 15 minutes before their shift and stay 15 minutes after their shift to count the money in the tills. We were also told if the tills were short, we had to pay it back out of our own pockets on the same day - no exceptions. Of course if the tills were up, they'd just call that a win for them and pocket the extra cash. The staff always lose.

Naturally everybody was pissed about this except for one brown-nose who said it was great that people have to take responsibility for their mistakes (I guess unpaid overtime will teach us a lesson, right?). I'm usually very quiet and introverted, but I will absolutely speak out from something I truly believe in, or protest against something I don't. I was first to speak out against these new policies and questioned their legalities to which the area manager responded with something along the lines of ""Feel free to check their legality, I assure you that we won't be breaking any laws"".

So I did exactly that. Later that night I went home and checked our laws and unsurprisingly everything they were enforcing was illegal here. The area manager is based in Ireland which more than likely has different employment laws but his ignorance to our different laws and situation was painfully obvious. I called up the equivalent of a union (they don't exist here either) and they confirmed that it was illegal and advised me not to adhere to the policies.

Next shift comes around and I roll in at 11am (my start time) and immediately the other staff start kicking off. I went upstairs, counted my float in the 15 minutes they expected it to take and then actually started working at 11:15. I explain myself to the rest of the staff and showed them evidence and they all decided to follow suit. Everybody except for brown-nose. She insisted that we all ""needed to do our part for the company"" (that pays us minimum wage don't forget) and that we ""should be grateful for the jobs"" (Still minimum wage). None of us took that on board and left her to carry on working for free if that's her choice. I think she was expecting something from the boss for her ""dedication"".

The local manager was also on our side but he did have to tell the regional manager what was happening. On the regional manager's next visit about a month later, he started having meetings with the staff to investigate what this was all about and why were weren't sticking to the policy and they all pointed towards me telling them not to. When he got round to the meeting with me he was **pissed** and started kicking off at me and asking why I was so determined to overrule him, to which I replied ""You told me to check the legalities of the policies, so I did"" and showed him the evidence in the form of our local employment laws on my phone.

Defeated, he left and decided to withdraw all the policies, including the ones where we had to waste time counting the floats and pay back any shortages. The rest of the staff there liked me for it, except from brown-nose but nobody liked her anyway.

TL;DR - company tried to pull some illegal unpaid overtime and deductions, told me to check the legalities if I didn't believe them. Did exactly that, told them to shove their new policies which they had to do as well.",MaliciousCompliance,1627658165,bawta,92,1,self-post
2021-07-30 09:01:57,Follow the flag code to the letter or you'll be fired!,"This happened about 10 years ago. I was struggling to figure out where my life was headed, what I wanted to do for a career, typical existential crisis stuff. I quit my job in the auto industry to feel out a few other career paths. I landed on security guard for an industrial complex in middle Georgia. Big company in a small town. Pay was great, it was night shift so it worked well with my non existent sleep schedule, and it was an interesting change from what I've done most of my life.

 I loved it at first, until my boss changed his shift to overlap with mine in the morning. The dude was nuts, he had delusions of grandeur, he was a pathological liar, frequently made up stories about being in the Navy seals with Stephen Segal, he was a quarter master in the Navy for 4 years before he filed a disability claim after he knocked over a storage rack and it fell on him. 

One of his biggest pet peeves was the massive flag the company had. He printed out a few dozen copies of the flag code and told us to follow it to the letter, including putting it up and down every morning and night. Being night shift, I was almost always the person putting it up.

One morning there was extremely bad weather and, per the flag code, I didn't put the flag up. My boss came in about an hour later and ran his first rounds and noticed the flag wasn't displayed. I pointed at the specific section of the flag code that says not to display it during inclement weather and he absolutely lost his mind. Berated me for 30 minutes. 

When it was time to clock out, he was still berating me but I just stood up, clocked out, and left our little shack. The next day I show up and he tells me I'm suspended. Cool, I get a free night off. I come back two days later and the district manager is there with my boss. We sit down and chat. My boss keeps interrupting me and insulting me so I told the district manager that I'm leaving if my boss doesn't let me speak. The dm takes me elsewhere to finish the convo. I explained everything that happened, showed him the flag code. Showed him the weather that morning, and then told him about my boss threatening to fire me if I didn't follow the flag code and then berating me for 30 minutes for following the flag code. 

The district manager and I walk in to the security shack and sit down with my boss. The district manager proceeded to tell my boss that he's being fired for harassment and for violating his own flag code policy. I ultimately left a week later because I found a better job elsewhere, but it was one of the most satisfying things I've ever experienced.

2021-07-30 09:01:18,Malicious compliance with bill collectors,"A few years ago, I messed up my credit. Got in a lot of debt with a bunch of individual credit cards but I’m well on my way to climbing out of the hole. I have one account left to pay, with a fairly well known debt-collecting law firm handling it. The middle of the three partner’s names is similar enough to “felch” that I have been saying it regularly in every call and haven’t been corrected. 😁

Today, my first call had a little hold time, maybe ten minutes, and the lady that answered seemed pleasant enough. I told her I wanted to make a payment and she verified and looked up my account and the call got disconnected. I called back and sat on hold for longer, closer to 20 minutes. I spoke to a woman who sounded like she was new. We got all the way to asking me how I’d like to pay, and then she put me on hold for 5 minutes before the call disconnected again. 
So now I’m getting frustrated. I just want to make a payment and move on. This 5 minute operation is on the back-half of an hour with no end in sight. I call back again and sit on hold for 20 minutes. I get a man who’s uncommon name (John) I recognized. He’s a manager I worked with to set up my initial payment plan. I once again explain that I’m just trying to make my payment. He says my account is flagged.

“You’ll have to talk to an attorney before you can talk about your account”

I asked him if that was really necessary for me to just make a payment. Judgements, or liens or something like that, sure. Setting up the initial payment plan? Maybe. But just to make a payment that’s already scheduled? 🙄 Fine. He told me he had an attorney available right now and could transfer me. When the attorney answered, I got his name and extension number. He pulled up my account and asked what I needed. I told him I needed to make a payment, but I’d been getting kicked around until i wound up on his desk. He then made the mistake of mentioning he was on his way out the door to a court appearance and tried to brush me off, “But I’ll call you back in an hour” and I remembered John telling me I HAD to talk to an attorney before talking about my account. I took this opportunity to see how long I could talk to him.

“Well gee Mr. Attorney, I’d hate to hold you up, and it won’t take but a second, here I’ll just explain…..”
And I went on and on. I explained in great detail, nonsense. How I accrued the debt. How the debt came to be unpaid. How I was working hard to make the payments.

“And I don’t think I’ve ever been late or missed a payment, have I, Mr. Attorney?”

“No, no missed payments. But I really have to get…”

“Oh Mr. Attorney, I’ve taken up too much of your time I’m so sorry that you were roped into this situation while you’re so obviously a very busy man, I just so wish that John or those other ladies I spoke with were able to take my payment, but they mentioned it had to be someone with more education, an attorney specifically and I’m sorry that you, being as busy as you are happened to be the attorney that John picked, and roped you into this, you know I really appreciate you taking the time, it’s just been so difficult with everything over the last year and a half, with COVID and the political turmoil…..”

And I kept going. Leaving him to try to get a word in, too polite to just hang up or raise his voice. I kept him on the phone, rambling about whatever I could think of. Repeating apologies for wasting his time. I did eventually let him go, but not before I reminded him of his name and extension number and told him I’d talk to him very soon. 

TL:DR- After an hour of getting transferred around I was told I needed to speak to an attorney first to make a payment to a collection agency, so I wasted 20 minutes of a busy attorney’s day talking about nothingness and promised to call back soon to waste more.",MaliciousCompliance,1627657278,abortion-number-five,43,1,self-post

Cop: Can I get one pack of [insert cigarette brand here]

Me: Can I see some ID?

Cop: *slowly pulling out his ID* yeah… you know you have to be 21 or older to be a cop, right?

Me: *in a playing dumb sort of tone while grabbing his ID* oh really? Well how on EARTH would I know that??

Cop: well now you know *displays a playful yet triumphant smile*

Me: but you also know that state law says I NEED to card everyone under 40, and you’re- *flashing his ID back at him* clearly under 40, so who would be the one in the wrong here?

2021-07-30 04:48:00,"If you won't let us sleep, you're not going to either.","Dunno if this is correct here but here goes. 

This happened me and my family(wife and 2kids age 6 and 7) a few weeks ago on a cruise to Italy. 

We had no problems for a few days on the cruise(we had balcony room, relevant later) and on the 3rd day we got new neighbors. 2 old ladies somewhere around 60-70 years old so i thought nothing of it. 

On their first day at 12am in the morning they came on their balcony drunk and started talking so loud, almost shouting. We had our balcony open to enjoy the sea so of course we were all awoke from all the noise. I asked them then to be quiet and instantly i got shot down saying ""close your balcony then"".

We called the reception and informed them of this and they said that they would send someone to talk to them. After 30min and nothing happening i went down to the reception with my wife and talked with the reception and pressured them a bit more. They said that they can't do anything and can't force them out of the room and can only ask them to be quiet. Fuming we went back to our room and closed to balcony to sleep. Day 1 end.

The next day i was dreading that the idiots would again start their screaming match and i was correct. At 2am the came on the balcony and this time my wife who is normally very timid and patient started shouting at them to be quiet. The old ladies responded with ""why are you so angry? You're crazy"" which infuriated my wife even more. We talked and also went to the reception and they said they couldn't do shit, can't force them out of the room and said we can spend the night somewhere else and can move us to another room in the morning. We spent the night at another room because i wanted my children to sleep so we had to carry both of the in the middle of the night to another room. But i didn't want to move to another room because a) why the fuck are we the ones to move when we haven't done anything wrong? b) my parents were also on the cruise and on the same level.

Because of all the adrenaline i couldn't sleep all night and suddenly i had a stroke of pure genius. If the reception can't force them out of THEIR room, that means they can't force US out of our room too. 

That's when i went back to our room, hammered on their door to give them a chance to keep what was coming civil, and when they didn't open their door, i got a snorkel and started hammering on their balcony glass. This is somewhere around 7am and at 3am as we carried the kids to another room they were still awake so they had max 4 hours of sleep. 

I'll spare you the small details but i spent 2 hours knocking on the glass(which made the loudest noise) with intervals so they wouldn't get used to the noise, they came twice outside to grab my snorkel, and video taped me, all the while while i said ""come out i wanna talk"". During all this they must've called the reception countless times because during the 2 hours i once had a card on my room door to call the reception. At the end the manager from the customer service came herself and talked with me where i patiently told my side of the story(the old cows still refused to come out of their room and talk like adults) and that the reception couldn't do anything and that i just wanted to talk.

The old cows used all the excuses possible(we're old, we can't move, i'm scared of that deranged man which they meant me and my ""weapon"") but in the end they had to move because i said many times as their room door opened that if we won't sleep, they definitely won't. 

So all in all reception can't do shit, and i had the savage pleasure to wake them up and kick them out of their room",MaliciousCompliance,1627642080,cold_hoe,101,1,self-post
2021-07-30 04:42:59,Mom got exactly what she asked for!!!,"So this is a very small malicious compliance , it was basically done by my brother when we were 11 years old.
So growing up my family didn't quite struggle with money but we do have to watch our spendings, especially during first 10 years of our lives my parent's started saving for a house and most of the money would go towards savings. 
One thing however which my father never compromised on was anything related towards our education. It didn't matter how expensive something was if it was towards education he will find money for it. 

Now my brother had a habit, he used to have all the pencils, colors basically any stationary than can be sharped, would always be sharped. He would quickly run out of stationary that way and always wanted the most expensive options which again would run out within a span of minimum two weeks.

My mother irritated, scolded him for always sharpening and quickly running out of his supplies and that was the beginning of his malicious compliance.
My mother used to help him with homework and after that my brother always started giving her pencils that weren't sharp at all like to the point where it was annoying to write it with them. He used to deliberately used them that way to annoy my mom.

And she knew what he was doing so she never sharpened them herself. That went for that entire year and ultimately he started using pen for his next grade.",MaliciousCompliance,1627641779,iselenaii,10,1,self-post
2021-07-30 03:27:32,"If I ask too many questions, it will raise red flags... Oh I have to? Okay then.","I am keeping everything vague on purpose, just to give myself some plausible deniability. Apologies if it confuses anything. 

I recently received a promotion within my company to work on the compliance team. My first task was to look at the projects that had been recently started and ensure they were compliant with local laws.

The first project I came across, I realised had disregarded multiple local laws of that country.

Like a good little worker, I took this information to the project lead with some recommendations on how we can fix it easily and still have the project running smoothly. She was... Less than pleased. Not with the fact that laws were being broken but with me, for 'attempting to complicate the process'.

She told me that unless I had confirmation from the police and local government that it wasn't allowed, she didn't care. I explained to her that if we start asking these questions, it could raise red flags and cause a lot of issues if someone decided to investigate . Apparently I was being 'ridiculous' and didn't know what I was talking about. She told me that unless I came back with proof, then she didn't want to hear about it.

Okay then... You want proof. I'll go kick that hornets nest and get you some proof.

I went away and began contacting those involved. Now I tried so hard (really, no sarcasm there) to make my questions as innocuous as physically possible. Attempting to look more curious than anything else, until one person said

'Why are you asking these questions? We were told about this previously and that you would do X. If this is what you are doing, then these questions are strange'

Fuck.

They were right. If we were doing what we said we were, then these questions don't make sense.

Fuck.

I stated that we were curious, looking at how we can adapt the process but I could tell, even over email, that they weren't convinced.

I had enough info to take to the project lead, not as much as I would like but enough. 

When I took this to her, she looked at it, said 'hmm' and told me she would look into it. I explained the suspicion but I got hit with the word 'ridiculous' again. I had done what she asked, I was done. 

Fast forward a few weeks, I get a call telling me to join a zoom meeting with the ceo, the project lead and the head of HR. 

I joined, she threw me under the bus. Apparently it was my fault that the local government was up our asses as I hadn't vetted the project properly and had 'tipped the government off' rather than fix it. No idea what she was thinking as all I had to do was show the emails where I explained that asking about was a bad idea and my emails going back and forth with the authority. Ceo went quiet and then thanked me and asked me to disconnect. 

It's been a couple days, Fuck knows what happened but I know all of her projects got reassigned and I haven't heard from her at all. I've also been asked to implement my plans and liase with the authorities to ensure everything is as it should be.

I'd like to see them try!,"This happened about a decade ago when I was in university, finals were coming up and the charging port on my laptop was giving out and eventually the pin inside just completely broke. Luckily I had warranty and the usual repair time was less than a week so I brought it in to be fixed. The guy at the counter explained to me that when they send the laptops away for repair it's policy to wipe the hard drive and factory reset the computer, even if it's an issue like mine that has nothing to do with the OS. He was very nice and apologetic about it and agreed it doesn't make a lot of sense but he said those are the rules. Now I had all of my notes and what not on there and it would have been a disaster to lose all of that, I was mortified but then a light bulb flicked on in my head so I asked him if the laptop is required to have a hard drive in it to be repaired. He looked a little confused and said no, it's a mechanical issue so they'll just fix the charging port, but again, it's policy to reset the computer. So I asked him if I could borrow a screwdriver and I saw the light bulb flick on for him too. He had a huge grin while he went to get me a screwdriver, watched me take out the hard drive and packed up the driveless computer to be repaired. When it came back the charging port was fixed, I popped the HDD back in and all was well!",MaliciousCompliance,1627621998,SETHlUS,70,1,self-post
2021-07-29 22:54:22,I taught my HOA a lesson on rules and regulations!,"I used to rent a condo in a beautiful beach complex that had an…active HOA board. Each unit had at least one parking spot, but most were not garages. Just car ports. In the front of each spot, you were allowed to keep your bikes locked up. The only problem is security was not ideal so one night, a truck drove in, threw a bunch of bikes in the back, and drove out past the 24 hour security guard. That was a huge issue in itself but people could also just walk in and ride bikes out….

When I moved in, I heard the issues about bike theft so I chose to keep my bikes locked up on my first floor patio. I didn’t think it was an issue since:

1) My patio faced a WALL; and 
2) There was no walkway to go by my place unless you walked on a non-approved dirt path my neighbors and I used to get into our places.

At least I didn’t THINK it was an issue until the HOA said that per the Rules and Regs, bla bla bla, I couldn’t keep anything on my patio that was not on the approved list of general patio items (table, plants, etc.).

I was on good terms with the owners, who passed along the written warnings. They agreed it was fine to keep my bikes there since they would otherwise be stolen. And then I was told I would be fined REAL American money if I didn’t keep my bikes inside or in the car port!

And then…I went litigious and petty on the HOA. I’m an attorney and I knew I could not be the only person who was not following the rules perfectly. I also knew they could not apply the rules unequally to individuals.

So what did I do? If you think I carried the rules around the complex and took photos of every single violation I could find, you are CORRECT!

To name just a few of the 15-20 really dumb violations I found….

1) Blue patio umbrella instead of neutral color? PHOTO
2) Personalized items that were not related to plants (dog statues, wind chimes, personalized college placards in the car ports, etc.)? PHOTO
3) Curtains that were not lined in white, facing the road? PHOTO
4) Gardening tools not inside some type of cabinet? PHOTO

And the pies de resistance (French?):

4) Another bicycle parked on someone’s patio! Mother.fing.PHOTO!!!!

And then I spent over 2 hours at work printing color copies of every single photo violation, organizing the violations into subsections, creating 4 binders for HOA board members to review, and attended the meeting where I was to be fined.

As you can imagine, I was not fined. In fact, I understood there was a discussion on how hard they wanted to push on compliance on these rules. However, I WAS respectfully asked to place a tarp over my bikes so it would be less obvious (finnnneeee….)

I moved out soon after that and thankfully, that was the last I ever dealt with such sophmoric losers. However, I strongly encourage other members of this group to do the same when asked to comply with dumb rules!",MaliciousCompliance,1627620862,sequinhappe,94,1,self-post

My friend had lived in his apartment complex for a few years and his fiancé and him were in the market of buying a house.  Well, the time came and an opportunity came and they put an offer on a house.  They still had 6 months on their lease and asked the management what their options were.

Management told them, they would have to pay a months rent to break the lease.  He agreed and assumed it would be on his final statement (the following month).  The final statement comes and it's for the remainder of the lease ($10k +).  He told them what he was told and of course ""that isn't their policy so they aren't sure why he would have been told this and he was on the hook for the remainder of the lease.""

He remembered seeing advertisements from his community about a 30 day grace period of backing out a new rental agreement (prior to actually moving in and just securing your spot).  He then asked if the unit got rented out before the end of his old lease if he would still be on the hook.  They told him once it's rented out they will release the charges and he will only be on the hook for one month of rent.

He then asked them for an application and applied to rent the exact same unit, waited for the charge to drop from his balance and cancelled his application.",MaliciousCompliance,1627597770,Phatferd,244,1,self-post

2021-07-29 13:45:31,Want to change the rules for just me? Good luck with my replacement.,"So this is something that has been building for the last 10 weeks but is just now coming to a head this week. Fair warning, this is going to be winded and long as there is a lot of malicious compliance gradually building up. 

I got a job 4 years ago at a small but successful printing company. Over these last 4 years I worked really hard with the owners to make changes and improvements to the company. I learned to do a lot of the behind the scenes stuff that must employees would not learn or even be given the chance to learn. A lot of what I do, I only know how to do. 

Fast forward from the 4 years of starting to 3 months ago. The owners take everyone out to lunch and announce they are selling the company to one of the other employees so they can retire. They originally approached me with the offer but I declined because this offer came mid-COVID, I didn't want to assume the risk, and was WAAAAY short of the deposit needed for a small business loan. 

At the lunch meeting for the announcement, of course the new soon to be boss says there won't be any changes, blah blah blah the typical new owner taking over BS. 

After the lunch meeting and a little more time passes, the new boss is now in charge and takes her first swing at me. With the previous owner I had my schedule worked out to be a little offset from everyone else in order to do some of the things I needed and to commute to work with reasonable traffic. Well this doesn't fly with the new boss because ""it's not fair to the other employees"" that my schedule is deferent. By the way, the difference was 30 stupid fucking minutes in the most dead part of the day where one person could easily run the whole office. 

Fine. Whatever. Now I'm clocking in and out exactly when the new boss listed and a lot of what I used to do is now getting left undone. 

Second swing. After some more time a new person was hired to take the new boss responsibilities from their old position. Now one of the things I do for the printing company is do a lot of the design for new customers. I'm really good and decently fast at it. Not a brag, just a fact of doing the specific for of design for the company for 4 years. Now the new boss wants the new hire to start doing it because sales aren't what they want them to be and they think it's my design style. At least that was the excuse given to me. Just to satisfy my own curiosity, I go and check the same reports for the month since I am one of free people with access to it. At the time of the excuse, same were up almost 11% from the same time period last that. The following year they were up nearly 6% despite COVID. Again. Fine. Whatever. 

Now the new person knows HOW to do the job, but the lack of experience makes them painfully slow at it. Now on top of my changed schedule and work not being done, the art requests that come in over night are now lucky to go out by 13:00 (1:00 pm). So my curiosity peaks again and tells me to check the same reports again for the time period the new hire has started. To my ABSOLUTE NOT SURPRISE, sales are pretty much dead even and bordering on hitting the red if the trend continues. 

Quick side story. Up until this point my wife had been job hunting. At about this point she got hired with a substantial salary increase. Borderline f*** you money. Your can probably tell where this is headed but let's put a pin in that for a little bit longer. 

Final straw is actually 2 things but they were close together so we'll count it as one. Now with all this the new boss informs me that the vacation time I had prescheduled with the previous owner is not fair either and I have to choose certain dates to take. I then decide to take cancel one of the times I had and none it to the following week and take that off instead. After getting back from vacation, I'm asked about my kids daycare situation. It's early June now. 

Since COVID I had been working from home after lunch to take care of my son since daycares closed for a while. Since vaccine rollouts started, every daycare within 20 miles of my place has a waiting list 3-6 months out and because of the business, is first come first serve. Even if what was a place you were at until the shutdowns. No priority system for anyone.

We luck out and find a place that can have us start August 23rd. I let the new boss know in June this start date. After being asked about it again at the end of July, I reiterate the start date and get meet with silence. The following day I get an email saying that is unacceptable and I either start back full time August 2nd in office or be moved to part time permanent. 

After some math, my wife and I come up with a solution. I respond back and say it's my 2 weeks notice and the final week I will only be part time. Thanks to my wife's new job, we can easily afford one income and I get to be a stay at home dad for a while. 

Now on top of everything else not getting done, the one person who knows most about the company maintenance is leaving and at an accelerated schedule as well and with nowhere near enough time to teach everything or even 20% of what I know to other employees. Since my notice, I haven't even been asked about the million behind the scenes things I do like website updating and what not and I'm not bringing it up unless asked. 

tl;dr be boss thought they could change stuff only for me and no one else and I'd take it. Ended up working down productivity and losing a good worker.",MaliciousCompliance,1627587931,Baaron1688,29,1,self-post
2021-07-29 13:28:46,Karen doesn’t like my behavior towards her out of control dog.,"This happened weeks ago but I’m still steaming, so figured I’d vent here. I was at our local dog park with my very sweet little dog who was frolicking in the distance. I was posted up on a blanket on a small grassy hill watching him, with his treats and water beside me. Some strange dog comes running up to me and starts gulping up all of the water. I don’t mind because it’s hot and this poor dog is obviously very thirsty. I gave him a pat and he must have been thankful because he jumped on me and started trying to lick my face/tackle me. He was sweet but a big dog and I was having trouble getting out from under him without making an embarrassing scene, so I was kindly and gently just trying to push him away. As I lay there, pinned on the ground by this large dog that was being playful but very rough, I hear a woman yell at me and I see her from the corner of my eye come running over, wagging her finger at me. She has the AUDACITY to yell and say “if you’re going to let my dog do that, you need to put on a mask- I don’t want you getting us sick.” I say “I am not letting him do anything, can you please get you dog off of me.” She comes over and pulls her dog off of me and starts to say something else (def not an apology) when I cut her off and say “if you’re going to let your dog in other people’s space, you need to wear a mask. I don’t want you two making ME sick.” She was speechless (one of those people who obviously never had anyone stand up to them because she is so confrontational) and I walked away 💁🏼‍♀️",MaliciousCompliance,1627586926,Brave_SoupDumpling,10,1,self-post

This happened several years ago, back when I was in tenth grade, around 2015 when I was 18 years old(I was held back/had to repeat fourth grade). After a small accident in a P. E. lesson I bruised my right hand's middle finger(luckily it wasn't broken or fractured) and had it and my index finger bandaged rather thick.

Naturally, as I'm right-handed, I couldn't write, let alone hold a freaking pen.

Now, this was done during History, where the whole class was together and we're usually split in half for several other subjects. We had to write a test that day and I informed my teacher, Mrs Grunty(obv fake name), about said issue and she CLEARLY saw said bandage as I rose my hand to show it to her so she couldn't say that I faked it. I don't know why, but I think she hated me, as did most my classmates, but I digress. Then, the following conversation ensued:

Me: Mrs Grunty, I'm sorry, but I can't write! As you can see, my hand is bandaged and I'm--

Grunty: I don't care! Write that test or else you will get an F! And don't even bother to come up with another excuse just so you don't have to do your work! 

Me: (visibly anxious bc she was yelling at me) A-alright...


After a quick moment to calm myself, she had gone back to her desk and I enacted my Malicious compliance.

I put my pen between my thumb and pinky finger, which was very awkward, and wrote in a shaky, slightly painful manner. Everything was still recognizable enough, though. After being done and putting it on her desk after everyone else had finished, she looked at the sheet and then at me.

Grunty: What is this garbage! This looks so sloppy and unclean! You're lucky if I give you an E for that! Your writing usually isn't THAT terrible!

Me: (blank-faced) Well, you DID tell me to write...

She didn't say anything after that and I went back to my desk with a smirk, feeling proud. Later on, I got the result back and it was a B.


So that's my story about how I got some malicious compliance done on a teacher that tried to humiliate me. Sorry for the post being so long. I hope it's complying to the rules of this sub!",MaliciousCompliance,1627580916,Charara999,38,1,self-post
2021-07-29 11:42:46,Well that was stupid,"This is an MC that happened to my friends and I years ago when we were teens.

Cast: Me, Mike (the driver) and Steve

When I was  teen I was what some people might call ""bad"". My friends and I were the ones at school who drank and did illegal substances. My friend Mike had a 1981 Ford LTD he rebuilt from a junkyard. We used it on the back roads because it wasn't street legal. Although there were a couple of times we took it into town for a risk. 

On most of the back roads there was not a lot of houses but one road we used had around 5 or 6 houses. The houses were old farmhouses way back off the road so we decided to play mailbox baseball. Steve was up first and the mailbox he hit was a wooden one that turned to splinters when hit. Next was my turn. I took the metal rod and missed the first box but got the second one. A tin one that flew off the post and was ruined. 

Mike said, "" My turn."" He aimed the car toward the next mailbox and sped up about to ram it with the car. The car hit and spun around. We almost ended up in the ditch. It was pure luck we didn't. The right front fender was folded back like it was opened by a can opener. Lucky it didn't kill the car so we drove away as fast as we could.

The next day we drove that road again just to see the mailbox that took out the car. It was shaped like a lighthouse. Wide at the bottom and tapering to the top with 4 sides. We got out to look at the damage we did to the mailbox. Other than a scuff of blue paint from the car and a couple of boards moved slightly there was zero damage. Looking inside where the wood was pulled away we could see the owned had built the framework for his mailbox and filled the inside with concrete. I think he might have had someone do that to his mailbox before so he ""fixed"" it so it can't happen again.

We picked a different road to play mailbox baseball after that. Mike got another fender from the junkyard and we put it on before going back out though. It is a good thing we used Mike's car. Most of the time I borrowed a car from my parents when we went out driving. I wouldn't be here today writing this if we used one of mom or dad's cars.

2021-07-29 04:16:56,"Make me come in on a Sunday? Fine, but I'm going to play Monopoly!","Years ago, I worked in the office of a distribution centre for a builders merchant, full of very petty 'us vs. them' types. Every July, there was a summer stock take over the weekend, which was compulsory, but overtime was paid. This consisted of last orders being picked and sent from the warehouse, outstanding  errors etc being cleared off the system in the office on Thursday, count on Friday and Saturday (office staff would join in after a quick refresher on the warehouse management system) then Sunday would be a catch up order picking/sending day so branches would be running as usual on Monday morning. Office staff were not trained/employed for picking, and we weren't needed on the floor. For several years we got away with not having to work on Sunday but one year, the pettiest of the petty women caught wind of us not working on Sunday and went to management to demand that we work it. If everyone has to work all weekend, that should be *everyone*. 

The DC manager told us that we would have to work it, we asked what we were supposed to do. Our job was to answer calls from branches (closed on Sunday), and sort out issues from the day's deliveries (which didn't happen on Sunday). Manager insisted, so we said that we would come in but we were bringing party food and playing Monopoly since there was no work to do. 'Fine, do what you want, as long as you're here and in the office'.

Sunday comes, we stick to our word and have a lovely day playing Monopoly, eating treats, listening to music, I think I'd even brought a portable DVD player and we watched a movie. The onsite HR manager came in at one point and asked us what we were doing so we explained, I could see her mentally calculating how much double time we were getting paid to play board games and she stalked off to shout at the DC manager whilst we were in the clear.

2021-07-29 00:51:00,Wanna force teenagers to clean for the night crew? Enjoy a bigger mess than what would have been there.,"So I'm not the proudest of this as there were 3rd parties that got caught in the crossfire, but I was a teenager. 

I worked at a movie theater while in high school, and it was a busy city so we were open pretty late on weekends. Normally as an usher we would clean every theater until the final showing of the night started, which was was usually midnight. My manager had a wonderful idea of how we could help the night crew. We were told we had to stay late(2-3 hours) and wait for the theaters to clear, and grab the big trash to help the night crew, so candy boxes, cups, popcorn buckets etc. 

Queue malicious compliance, they just want the big stuff right? we placed the trash can in the middle of each theater and played trash basketball. Full cup of sprite left behind? Kobe! Popcorn bucket left half full? Shoot it anyway and let the popcorn rain down. Leftover liquor shot bottles, just because they were empty didn't mean we couldn't take a shot, if the big stuff becomes little stuff I guess its not our problem. The state of the theaters was appalling after we followed her instruction.

We never had any blowback, but that manager never closed again, and often worked shifts when the main manager was there. We ended up with the cool 3rd manager that had no shits to give about that place, who just let us be as long as the theaters were clean and we weren't messing with customers too much. We also stopped clocking out and she was too lazy to back date our time cards, so we got paid till 3am anyway.",MaliciousCompliance,1627541460,The_Minshow,4,1,self-post
2021-07-28 21:29:41,Teambuilding activity? I think I'll pass,"I just remembered this story from about 6 years ago. I (11M at the time) was attending band camp with a large number of other kids and we were split into groups to do different activities throughout the day. Each group was about 10-15 kids large I believe. Anyway, my group was designated to go play some outdoor games and teambuilding activities. Everyone in my group knew each other though, so we instead just had fun playing around. The malicious compliance come in during the teambuilding exercise.  Our group leader had us play a game that was basically the floor is lava. We were given a large assortment of things to try and cross the field (lava). Obviously the intention was to have everyone work together to build some sort of bridge across, but we were kids and we wanted to mess with the adults. There were some things like a large rug or a few wooden planks, etc. Everyone tried to have some fun with it, but we all agreed that my idea was the most memorable afterward. One of my friends grabbed the rug and started hopping across the lava. Another few tried various tricks and similar stuff, but no one made it too far without falling (lol). I however saw two frisbees and seized the chance. I put the frisbees under my feet and started scooting towards the other side. My entire group was rolling over laughing, and the team leader was staring at me in disbelief. I proceeded to scoot all the way to the other side while everyone was still at the beginning basically crying with laughter. My team leader was not amused and told me ""you really should try working with the others"". Afterwards I came back and once everyone calmed down we actually completed the challenge in a more traditional fashion, but seeing my group mates like that and the face my team leader made always brings a smile to my face. 

&amp;#x200B;

TD;DR: Team leader wanted us to work together to cross a field without touching it, but I used two frisbees to scoot across instead.",MaliciousCompliance,1627529381,Fugaku_Sanjurokkei,26,1,self-post

2021-07-28 15:47:25,Removed my till authorisations..,"I worked the night bar in a hotel as part of a duo. We worked great together but he hated any type of tech and unfortunately for him the till was a touchscreen.  

We were pretty much left to run everything overnight as everyone went home so to allow for this we were both given bar manager till authorisation meaning we could do refunds,voids, comp drinks, etc pretty essential stuff for the role.  Also, to do room service we had a small kitchen off the bar that was left stocked.  On top of the normal day to day stuff, on a Sunday I would run reports and fill out a night audit excel for the financial controller ready for Monday morning.  

A supervisor during the day didn't like that a lowly porter had bar manager clearance, and a chef, took umbrage with having to leave fresh prep ready every night for room service. Together they decided, with the joint brain power of a half idiot, that tonight they would lock the kitchen, and reset the bar manager authorisation to the basic setting. 

We arrive to work that night at half 11 in my colleagues Nissan and head in as normal after he has a quick smoke.  All goes as normal, the daytime people drift away and we get in the zone.  A wedding party is about to descend on us for the night and we're ready for action, restocked, ice everywhere.. and it's a special one because its the first Lesbian wedding the place has had.  It was not officially a wedding, as the marriage laws hadn't changed yet, being around 2002, but you get my drift. Its a special day and you do your best to make it a good time.

It's all going great, until its not. Someone wants change for smokes. My colleague puts his code in and the till won't open. Ok, we can do a transaction and workaround that.  Then in quick succession we both realise that we can't void, refund,comp and won't be able to cash up the till or do night audit, plus  no room service as no access to the kitchen.

Technically we could have went to the rigmarole of unlocking the main kitchen and scavenging but why? And it was far too busy to lose someone that long.

We tried, we really did, to adjust to having nothing, offering crisps and peanuts and coffee biscuits to the peckish, using our tips to make change, using my to phone taxis as a lock was active on the phone to prevent dialling out. But it was a farce.

In the morning we left our uncashed till in the safe with a signed note. I emailed the financial controller and cc 'd the general manager. I said sorry I couldn't do night audit, my authority was removed.  Also sorry for no room service and for the complaints that would be happening later, the kitchen was locked from both sides. Also I explained the delay in phoning taxis, why the till would make no sense and was uncashed.

We went home. Sleep happened. I was in solo on Monday night.  I arrive in, its quiet.  Everything is spotless, stocked , full.

The general manager and the financial controller come over, highly unusual at nighttime.  Sit down they say, and the three of us sit, the lady I'll be relieving brings down 3 coffees. This was clearly rehearsed.  

The manager says, what happened last night can never happen again. Reception received numerous complaints regarding last night's room service issue.  The night porter's were commended for trying to fix what happened. 

Financial controller, jumps in, Bar manager authorisation has been restored on everything for you both.  Verbal warnings have been issued to those that caused the problems and will be escalated if this ever occurs again.  

The supervisor left shortly after.  I dont know, or care what happened to the chef.  But I'm pretty sure Anthony Bourdain would call him a prick. Sorry for the novel.",MaliciousCompliance,1627508845,q2005,64,1,self-post

My company since the pandemic has worked almost entirely remotely and for the most part, it has worked well.

One problem is the plethora of meetings we have and the difficulty it causes scheduling meetings with multiple people.

One of the Project Managers has wrestled with this problem by finding available times for us all, at lunchtimes. After multiple days of having a portion or all my lunchtime ruined, I got very annoyed at him.

I was told that scheduling was difficult and that I needed to be lenient by management and needed to find time for your lunch, so I did.

From then on, I pre-prepare lunch and then eat lunch during the Project Managers meetings and when asked why I was doing that, I said I was making time for it.

2021-07-28 12:03:25,Brown noser doesn’t like me or my role,"I saw a similar post about a brown noser who loves to police other people’s time. 

So a few years back, I worked in a lab in a small employee owned metal plating shop. Now this was my first time in an employee owned shop and I was not prepared for the pettiness that I had to endure for 6 month before I quit and found a better position. 

A little background for those of you who have no experience in a lab. When running samples, time just goes by. Some samples take 10min and others take upwards to an hour. Now this shop had very strict hours for break and lunch- there was even a bell like a damn school. Anyway. I was not restricted to these bells because like I said, sample time varies. And my role was to make sure manufacturing doesn’t stop because of issues. 

Also, important note: I was the only qualified chemist on site of about 100 people. Yeah. I also overhauled their entire quality system to pass audits but lunch is what they focus on 

So onto the story. One day manufacturing was just shit- I’m one person testing 6 tanks because the solution wasn’t plating. From 5am- 3pm I was trouble shooting by myself because like I said, I’m the only chemist. So I didn’t eat lunch. Anyway at around 3:30pm, things quiet down and I eat my first meal of the day. Then suddenly out of the corner of my eye, I see someone taking my picture. SMH. Of course I can get an earful from management saying I have to take lunch when the bell rings. 

Onto the malicious compliance- any time I got a sample in around 10-11am, I strictly measured the time it would have taken me to finish said test. I would also do it very slowly and carefully. If I got a sample in at 11:30am- I would tell my boss “sorry this takes me an hour to do and lunch is in 30min. I’ll do it after my lunch break.” After a few days of this, manufacturing became shit. I just waited until after lunch. Guess who got permission to eat lunch whenever I wanted. I quit soon after with a job that paid $10k more a year with full benefits and a new renovated lab.",MaliciousCompliance,1627495405,curryp4n,124,1,self-post

2021-07-28 08:32:36,"Make up a BS lunchtime policy to appease the office drama queen? Sure, I'll follow it to the letter.","Many years ago I worked in back-office support in a large office with lots of departments. Generally speaking, we had core hours, especially for lunch. Core lunch hours were between 12-2, meaning you had to take your lunch sometime between 12-2. 

Different departments had different rules for lunch depending on their needs. For example, the call centre had a strict rota for when people could take their lunch since they needed constant phone cover. However, I was in back-office support. Things were a lot more relaxed because we rarely took phone calls. Most of our work came in the form of tickets and tasks logged through our system, and emails from other departments with general queries. The only requirement was that at least one manager and 2 members of staff had to be there at all times in case a colleague from another department needed to see us, or in an emergency, call us.

So, generally, we could take our lunch anytime we wanted as long as it was between 12-2. There was no policy telling us when to take our lunch aside from the one I already mentioned. I would always take my lunch at 12:28. The reason was I actually wanted to take it at 12:30, but one of our call centres was the floor above us and they stampeded down the stairs at 12:30. I had been in an accident some years ago that gave me issues with my back and hips, so I could be a little unsteady on the stairs so I left at 12:28 so I could avoid the call centre stampede. I suppose I could have gone at 12, but the staff canteen was never set up and never had food ready at 12, hence why I left at 12:28. 

Now, I always restarted work at exactly 1:28, sometimes a few minutes earlier. An hour was far too long for me so I was often back at my desk nursing a coffee while scrolling through my phone (which we were allowed to do as long as we were on break) by around 1pm as well. However, if a colleague came to me and asked for help, I always helped and just added the time I was helping them to my lunch. So if I spent 10 minutes helping a colleague, I'd come back at 1:38. All this would be logged in our timesheet. I wasn't doing anything outside of policy - we were allowed to do this.

Anyway, one of my colleagues had obviously noticed. Let's call her Mindy. Mindy considered herself the queen bee of the office. Everything had to be done her way, she was perfect, and she always tattled on people for petty stuff. Like that one of our colleagues used too many staples, or that colleagues were literally a few minutes late, or took too many pee breaks (she literally had a tally of how many drinks and pee breaks everyone took so she could tattle). She even once tried to tattle and say one of my colleagues came in drunk and she could smell it on her breath. What she could smell was Lemsip and cold meds - the colleague she was tattling on had a cold. Unfortunately, Mindy was also our manager's favourite employee, so she got away with a lot.

So she tattles to our manager about how I'm always leaving for lunch 2 minutes early and yet often come back late. My manager tears me a new one for this. I explain to him that the times I come back late are when I've helped a colleague and he should see it logged on the sheet. I also explain why I leave at 12:28. He then says 'Yes, well, whether it's two minutes or not, we have core hours in this office'. I say, yeah, 12-2. I can take my lunch any time between 12-2. 12:28 is within those core hours. So he then tried to say no, in our department, we have a policy of 12:30-1:30 to make sure enough people are in the department.

I say I've never heard of this policy, this has never been the case, but he brushes me off and says, 'You take your lunch at 12:30, and come back at 1:30. You don't deal with any queries or anything that will delay you. Just take your lunch on time, and come back on time. No exceptions.'

Okay, then. That's exactly what I'll do. No matter what I am doing, even if I'm in the middle of a task, I get up and go to lunch. Even if I am at my desk and a colleague comes to me, I tell them I am on lunch and to come back later. Then surprise, surprise, Mindy comes along with an 'urgent' query at 1:10.

I look her dead in the eye and say 'Sorry, I'm on lunch.'

She storms off to our manager to tattle on me. I get called into his office because she had lodged a complaint against me for 'bullying' her and being 'uncooperative'. Mindy is in the office with my manager acting as a mediator and he asks why I refused to help her. She's grinning maliciously with her trademark 'You're going to get it' face.

'She spoke to me at 1:10. I had 20 minutes left of lunch. You said the policy is lunch 12:30-1:30, no exceptions."" I said, smiling.

Mindy looked like she wanted to slap me and my manager was furious but knew he couldn't do or say anything because that was what he said.

Eventually, the manager ended up being promoted and moved to another department. Our new manager had no patience for Mindy's excessive tattling and at one point shouted at her 'This isn't primary school and I'm not your teacher, go back to your desk and focus on your own work instead of everyone else!'

The new manager also rescinded the 'no exceptions' bs policy my manager had made on the spot and as long as we came back on time and didn't leave the department understaffed, she couldn't care less when we took our lunch.",MaliciousCompliance,1627482756,kathjoy,585,1,self-post

2021-07-28 07:18:00,Trading mail for sushi,"This just happened yesterday. 

So I have an address that is a unit number and then a street number like 15- 4725 but there's lots of units around here and there's also a unit 15-4735. Over the years I've gotten this person's mail on occasion and vice versa and we generally just either walk or drive the 100 m and deliver the mail.

I can't exactly see that unit from my house but I did see that it was for sale 6 months ago because the signs are at the road.

So anyway I get a call couple weeks back from the courthouse asking if I moved because they just got some mail that was returned as wrong address. (Don't worry it was good mail I was expecting it). Why can't they just deliver all of my junk mail to that wrong address? Why does it have to be something I was expecting and time sensitive?

So my guess is the place sold and the new people don't want to walk 100 m so they wrote, 'not at this address' which is not exactly true it's just that the mail got mixed up.

So yesterday I'm working in the backyard around 7:00 p.m. cuz there's more shade and super hot and the dogs start getting excited. 

I've got a 4-ft cedar fence out front and I built a little platform for the free newspaper that they always bring that is the same height as my fence right by the latch. It's great for putting stuff that you have in your hands so that you can unlatch the gate. That's where the coffee cup goes.

Basically the backyard is blocked off from the front yard cuz lots of people walking by and one of my dogs is a barky Barkersons. 

I didn't hear it but the dogs heard the latch  and started to barking and they're big dogs. I go to see if someone's at the front gate and sitting on top of my platform is a little cardboard box with to go containers.  I look at it, take it inside and looks like it's dinner for three, two containers full of rolls, some kind of beef and noodle dish and miso soup. My guess is the delivery driver heard a couple of big dogs and just left the delivery on my platform instead of taking a chance of coming in. 

So I say to myself, self, this must be the great jokester in the sky saying sorry for delivering my important mail to the wrong people. Please eat this sushi in return!  Of course, being the great jokester in the sky, one of the rolls was a yam roll and the other one had chicken or pork in it and sushi is not chicken or pork. The dogs got those ones!!!! 

I know the older couple that used to live at my almost twin address wouldn't be eating sushi but if they had a delivery like this I would hop in the car and send it over. 

I'm sure there's going to be comments regarding the delivery driver has to pay for it or the restaurant is out that order but it doesn't work that way. I worked plenty of restaurant jobs and if there's a mistake and an order has a possibility of being handled by a person who is not correct then we always remade it for security reasons. As far as the driver goes it was his mistake.",MaliciousCompliance,1627478280,RecommendationNo191,38,1,self-post
2021-07-28 06:18:01,"Won't fix your buggy software that costs us thousands of dollars per year? Fine, pay our bills then!","TLDR at the bottom. I hope you enjoy this one!

I am the AV supervisor for a large company that hosts events.

Specifically, I look after quotes for the technical side of corporate events - giving clients access to projectors, microphones, speakers, etc etc for their large corporate presentations, meetings and whatnot. I also manage and brief the floor crew who actively run the events.

We use a program to book our equipment which, while powerful, is a bit laggy on the average computer and is also \*extremely\* expensive per year (About $2000 per user per year and there's about 30 of us in the company that use it) Relative to how much our company makes per year, it's a pretty hefty cost. It's a good program when leveraged properly, but sometimes it can drive you mad with it's weird way of doing things.

One important feature of the program is that it tracks the booking of all equipment everywhere, including time for packing it into a room and packing it out of the room. This is useful because it prevents our team from overbooking equipment. If it's not available, the system won't let you book it - there's no way around that. If I am short on equipment, I can book extra equipment from another rental company and on-charge that to the client - when I know in advance that I need to do that.

Anyway, cue big presentation from the booking company showing their latest version of the booking software. ""It's great, it's faster! It's better than ever!""

We have a busy week come up and I am flat out floored with paperwork, pulling a 60 hour week (Our company is fantastic with overtime. We don't get overtime *pay* but we do get time in lieu. Our bosses are totally cool about it. So if I work 1hr overtime, I get 1hr off the following week. Do a 60 hr week and you get 20hrs off later)

Anyway, one of my floor crew comes to me...

Floor Crew: Hey OP? This equipment isn't available... We've already got it out on another event.

Me: What? It should be available.

Floor Crew: No, it's definitely not. I just set it up for another event two hours ago and that event is running for three days.

Cue me running back to me desk and rechecking all my paperwork. FYI, equipment lists going out for events is often over one hundred lines long - hence why we don't do manual checks for over-bookings. The system should do it. As it turns out, all our equipment was overbooked multiple times - in many cases, overbooked on three events or more.

I make multiple phone calls to rental companies and bring in rental equipment on short notice. That's expensive - and I can't charge it to the client on such short notice. If you took our expected profits for that week, you could add a negative symbol onto the front and that'd be our new profit.

I log a job with the company that makes our booking software and then proceed to double check all our upcoming events. Hooo boy... alotta overbooked equipment. (Note: These events are often independently created by multiple people at different times of the year, there's no way they'd themselves check if the equipment was available, it's just not feasible. Hence why we rely on the system that up until now, worked)

The booking software company is extremely dismissive, saying that its a rare glitch and that they'd ""look into it"".

Cue one month later and still no fix. I'm now spending *significantly* more time double checking all our events for overbooking. The booking software company still doesn't care about a small-ish company like us.

Frustrated, I ask my boss for a copy of our service agreement with the company. He's as annoyed with the situation as I am so we go through it together. Turns out, there's a clause in there saying that the booking company would provide compensation in the event of **total** system failure (In the event that the system can't even be accessed).

Well... we'd definitely call this a system failure... of sorts. It's failure is costing us a lot of money. So we send the bills of all our rentals that cover over-bookings to the booking software company. That gets their attention quickly when the total bill amounts to more than triple how much they make off *us* each year.

Booking Software Company: Hey OP, what's with these bills?

Me: Here's the job reference you still haven't responded to after two months now, and here's the link between each rental and each event that's overbooked.

Booking Software Company: Uhh... there's no way the system is letting you overbook equipment. And you can't send the bills to us for every event that's overbooked.

Me: \*Shares screen\* Alright... let's test it.

The Booking Software Company shares their screen as well, logging into our version of the booking system. They proceed to book some equipment that should 100% not be available. True to their word, the system doesn't let them do it. I then book the exact same equipment on the exact same event but from my computer. My boss as witness, the system lets me do it without any alarm. This surprises them and they start talking about potential fixes. They also say they're willing to pay for the rentals up **until** now.

Two months later, we're still billing them for every rented equipment, they're still paying without questioning and we still don't have a fix. I've changed the procedures to check for overbooked equipment though, so we aren't running around like madmen trying to fix things last minute anymore.

TLDR: Booking Software Company releases a software update, letting us unintentionally overbook equipment. They ignore our requests for a software patch and we leverage their service agreement for ""compensation"" in system failure.",MaliciousCompliance,1627474681,SadowSon,545,1,self-post
