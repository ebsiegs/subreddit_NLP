Earlier today we are walking along the shops in Waikiki and the urge to use the restroom hits as I been chugging water to stay hydrated. As we are in this shopping plaza we begin to look for a public restroom and find two that are closed. I notice the hostess of a restaurant standing near their entrance so we walk over and I ask, \"do you know where any other restrooms are as the two here are closed?\"\\n\\nShe snaps at me, \"sir, our restrooms are for customers only\" then proceeds to go back to playing on her phone as they aren\\'t busy.\\n\\nMy spouse started to walk away but I stopped and asked, \"do you have a table for two available?\" To which the hostess looks and says yes, then leads us to a table. We both ordered a water then I excused myself to the restroom. When I returned I placed a couple dollars ok the table for the server who\\'s table we had briefly occupied then proceeded to leave. The hostess was glaring at me the whole time.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I was reading a different post and was reminded of this...\\n\\nYears ago I bought a stereo receiver that came to $399. I had a coupon code that I would get $50 off a purchase of $400. So I looked for the cheapest item on the site and I found that you could buy speaker wire by the feet and there was a monster speaker wire that was exactly $1 per foot. \\n\\n15 minutes after the order I got a call from their ordering department making sure I didn't make an error. I explained the reasoning behind the purchase and told him that I didn't even care if I got the speaker wire I just wanted to use the promo code. He got a good laugh about it and that was the end of it..... Or so I thought.\\n\\nWhen my package arrived it was the receiver but no speaker wire but the order said box 1 of 2. The next day I didn't receive 1 ft of speaker wire.... I received a spindle of speaker wire. It was 1000 ft of speaker wire.\\n\\nI figured since the company was kind enough to contact me earlier I called them up. They were confused at first and was thinking I was upset. Eventually I was able to explain myself well enough and told them I would like to send back the 1000 ft of speaker wire. They told me that I could but I would have to pay for the shipping myself and that since I used a promo code that I would be getting charged the $50. I told them that I would just keep the speaker wire since the spindle and speaker wire was easily over 50 lbs.\\n\\nI ended up selling the speaker wire and I made about $400-$500 selling the wire.\\n\\nI guess that's the difference between the companies purchasing department and their customer service rep.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So a little short one, the problem of people taking smoke breaks during the work day, basically at my job on average the smokers take about 5-10, 5-15min (paid since they don\\'t clock out) smoke breaks.\\n\\nThe non smokers which are surprisingly in the minority (7 out of 25) including me asked to take a break when the smokers do. Manager says that they are only for smokers and if everyone went on them then there would be too much of a lack in productivity and we would fall behind. \\n\\nAs anyone can realize, that is bullshit. So I went online to Amazon and bought all of the non smokers \"Herbal Smokes that are Tobacco, Nicotine and Additive free\" basically just a cigarette filled with tea leaves. And we started going on smoke breaks but hanging out in our own corner to avoid the secondhand. \\n\\nThe manager comes out and starts yelling asking what we were doing, he thought we didn\\'t smoke, we should be working...to which we kindly pointed out that we had all decided to start smoking and that, well we were smoking along with everyone else there. \\n\\nThis lasted 4 days before the manager set limits to how many and how long smoke breaks are, and let the non smokers take the same breaks too.\\n\\nAlso: I am not sure about the health affects of Herbal Smokes, but considering we just lit the ends on fire then stood against the wall like some guys outside a club from the 80\\'s, so I think we\\'re fine.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'TLDR: Didn\\'t clean the apartment to my roommates standards, so I deep cleaned and left a sticky note saying \"f**k you. :)\" &amp; got a 60 day eviction notice. \\n\\nOkay, so I just moved in June 6th with my roommate, we\\'ll call them D,D &amp; I got along great for awhile but as time went on true colours &amp; intentions started to show. I am a very chaotic organized person, an art student &amp; my room is a complete disaster however outside of my space I like to keep common areas tidy, do my dishes as I use them, clean up my messes as I go along. You know, basic human stuff. Occasionally I would let the odd dish pile up but it would eventually get done. \\nSo D would become irritable, &amp; very, very nitpicky over the smallest of things. Photo frames being on the wall and \\'cluttering\\' them. Footsteps that only showed in the right light from natural foot sweat, or dishes piled up around the sink or a laundry hamper in the bathroom with clothes in it. (Only D could have a laundry basket in there.) It was fine at first and I figured that these small things would pass that it was just a phase of having a new roommate move in with D. So I just did as I was told &amp; cleaned up, did dishes etc. Mind you I did take my time with some because it did get under my skin a bit with the aggression &amp; consistency of the reminders to clean. I started to feel like a live in maid, &amp; started to feel like I didn\\'t have a choice in the matter. There was no talking with D, as all talking led to an inevitable \"f**k you.\" Or some form of confrontation &amp; eventually the decision to separate our things. I had my own food cupboard D had theirs. Etc. Please keep in mind D still ate my food during this time. \\nWell recently I had dirtied the balcony as I did my gardening and left it for a few days before I got to rearranging &amp; cleaning the whole thing. So sometime before that D brought out a stool &amp; just left it outside, &amp; I not thinking put a tomato on it. I left the pot on there, watered &amp; cared for my tomatoes &amp; as such the stool got dirty. \\nSo as I cleaned the balcony I realized \"oh this isn\\'t a table.\" So I removed my tomato, &amp; let the stool dry out before I brought it inside. I tried to talk to D explain to them that we didn\\'t have the space nor a use for the stool &amp; suggested we put it in the storage unit. D said if I cleaned it we\\'ll talk about it. So the next day while D was at work I took the initiative &amp; did some house work &amp; moved the stool to storage myself. So when D came home later &amp; was a bit irritated that I put the stool in storage without cleaning it off &amp; putting it in storage. I tried to explain that it could still be cleaned &amp; still left in storage with no harm to us both &amp; that\\'s when stuff really started to rile up. They got very aggressive &amp; when confronted they confirmed they were angry over the stool &amp; not getting their way. So that brings us to today, D goes to work but I have plans myself to go out. So I looked at the pile of dishes &amp; molding measuring cups &amp; the footprints you could only see at the right angle &amp; thought. \"F**k you.\" So in the time I had before my time to leave I cleaned every dish, knowing full well that I didn\\'t dirty any of them. I scrubbed the counter clean, &amp; organized the bathroom &amp; even mopped up those pesky footprints. At the end I didn\\'t have enough time to go into storage &amp; wipe the stool off but I did do everything else that was demanded of me prior. I chose the high road, but remember I didn\\'t do that stool. \\nAt the end when the apartment was cleaned I took my cutest sticky note a little bee and flowers &amp; left D a note\\xa0\"F**k you :)\" \\nI\\xa0 gathered my stuff &amp; left for a well deserved girls night out. \\nRoll around to when D gets home from work &amp; he snapchats me a handwritten note claiming I have 60 days to pack my stuff &amp; leave, 48 if I anger them further. \\nSo, here I am sipping my wine &amp; reveling in the thought of how I got kicked out for cleaning the apartment. \\n\\nEdit: I came home and found that all the food I had left prior to be thrown out.',\n",

It was mostly small pieces but big enough it wouldn\\'t fit in my car so I decided if rent a van.\\n\\nThe major Midwest hardware store in my city has a survival where you can get the van for $18.95. Their website said weekend rates were higher and if have to pay a deposit, but that was all. I figured still cheaper than a rental place so I went bright and early this morning and went to customer service.\\n\\nI asked the customer service lady about the process, she took copies of my license and my insurance and then plopped the rental agreement on the counter. \\nCs lady: Are you transporting things purchased here?\\nMe: no just some furniture.\\nCs: okay, without the purchase it\\'s a $300 deposit on a credit card\\n\\nOkay I know it\\'s a vehicle and it\\'s with more than $300, but that\\'s a big deposit for bringing it back in an hour. So I looked around and saw the snack cakes display.\\n\\nMe: actually I will be transporting things I bought here to.\\nCs: since you said you weren\\'t I have to have it on the same transaction.\\nMe: Not a problem.\\n\\nI grabbed a sleeve of little donuts and laughed as my total dropped from $330 to just over $100. I ran my card and finished the transaction in silence.  When I returned the van it got a very thorough walk around by the manager, I got my deposit back on my card from him and saw my cashier still staring daggers at me from the back. I was very glad I \"saved big money\" with their can today!',\n",

I have a medium sized backpack purse. \\n\\nI had it on one shoulder with the bulk of it sitting on my hip with my arm over it. I know where my arm is, I know where my hip is. I am not knocking into anything that way. \\n\\nThis old woman security guard tells me as soon as I get off the elevator on second floor to wear it on my front or carry it in my hands/arm. I kinda ignore her because I don’t think how I have it is a problem. \\n\\nShe yells at me in front of everyone to take it off. So I take it off and hold it on my arm. When I later walk back by her I make a point to swing my arm back and forth so the backpack is wildly swinging around and look directly at her and say “hmm doesn’t seem safer than it being secured on my hip”. \\n\\nPetty? Absolutely. But really use some damn sense. If my hip won’t knock over anything then my backpack being on my hip is safe.',\n",

Now, it is widely known thoughout the house that I am gifted (or cursed, depending on your viewpoint) in summoning very pungent aromas from my anus, and they are commonly a prelude to a poop for me.  This instance was no different.  \\nMy daughter was very irritated (13 year olds, dude) about me needing to interfere with her bathroom venture as I \"take forever in there\" and I tend to \"stink it up\", so I told her that I would wait until she got out.  \\nShortly upon exiting the bathroom after what I assume was a pleasant 30 to 40 minute shower, I hear an extremely agitated \"Oh my God, Dad!  My room stinks like farts!!!\" before a door slam.  I had been patiently waiting near the small hall by the bathroom, which is right next to her bedroom, reading some internet, repeatedly preluding for 30 to 40 minutes.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"So this sub made me recall an art exhibit I went to at the Boston MFA. They had a Murakami exhibit in 2018 that included lots of great examples of his works alongside the ancient works that inspired each piece. \\n\\nThe story associated with the piece is that a wealthy art collector had hired the artist and commissioned him to make the largest piece of scroll art in the country. His goal was obviously to have ownership of what he imagined to be an extremely valuable piece. But the artist decided that he would instead work smarter not harder.\\n\\nHe took an incredibly long scroll and made a small drawing of an archer on one end, an arrow sailing through the air in the middle and a small target on the opposite side. Probably took him 10 minutes. \\n\\nMurakamis version used his little Mr DOB character that looks like mickey mouse. \\n\\nObviously the benefactor was probably pissed but I'm trying to find something on the original artist because I was hoping to look it up. I had pics from the trip but they got deleted by accident.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Not sure if this counts but here goes. A few years ago I was working in a small bar in a mall. I hadnt been there that long, but I knew the place well enough after a couple of weeks. Me and a girl who had also recently started working there had made a pretty good team. We worked 8 hour shifts together almost every day and had a nice flow going on. \\n\\nThe manager had been looking for an assistant manger for a while and had decided to give the job to one the waitresses who had been there a while. This is when everything started going wrong. The waitress turned assistant manger decided that she was going to be telling everyone what to do and when to do it and how to do it. Now the girl that I worked every day with and I had a good understanding of the day to day traffic coming into the bar. We knew when it was going to be quite and when it wasnt. So we made sure to take our breaks during the quiet times. It never sat dead on the middle of our shift. We\\'d just take them knowing that we couldnt take them later or we would be leaving one of us swamped. So she\\'d go for a half hour then I would one day, and then I would and then she would the next day. The new assistant manger decided that wasnt right and that we shouldnt be doing that and that we should be taking our breaks in the middle of the shift. We both tried explaining to her that both us taking a break at the same time was dumb, and that it was better to do it now when it was quiet. But she knew better, she would take over bar duties while we were away. I guess she was seeing that it was dead and didnt think about it. \\n\\nAnyway, she really wants the bar cleaned, something we did everyday anyway, but she wanted it done now. So we did. We didnt prep for the rush, we didnt do anything but clean the bar. About 2 hours later, the mad rush starts. Theres three of us behind the bar taking table orders for the waitresses and serving punters that want to sit at the bar. It hit bang on the middle of our shift, and my and the girl downed tools and left the bar. The new assistant manager was like \"what are you doing? You cant leave now?\". My and the girl told her \"this is what you wanted. We tried to tell you, but you didnt want to listen. So its break time just like you said.\". We smiled, linked arms and went off to enjoy some food together. \\n\\nWe came back about a half hour later. The place was a shambles. Turns out the new manager had very limited experience working a bar. She didnt know how the coffee machine worked, she didnt know how to pull guinness. So the place was dead again, most people just going elsewhere. She was super pissed. Calling us all the cunts under sun, and that she was going to get us fired. Just an extreme rant complete with finger pointing. And that just made us leave again. We both quit on the spot and left her to explain to the manager what had happened. \\n\\nWe came back in later on in the week for our final pay and to return the t shirt uniforms. Had a sit down with the manager gave our side of it. Manager wasnt impressed with any of us. Which is fair enough. But I stand by what we did. We did everything to try and explain to the new assistant manager on the day, but she just wasnt for hearing it. She wanted things done her way and to lord her new power over everyone. I dont think anyone responds well to \"Im the boss, you do as I say!\". \\n\\nThe girl and I became friends outside of work for awhile but we got other jobs and just kinda drifted apart as you do.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'TLDR; Cleaned the apartment not to my roomies standards and my roommate evicted me. \\n\\nTo clarify I am only posting this because I need to rant a little and don\\'t really have anyone to do so with, plus please keep in mind I am not perfect and have my flaws. This is strictly as a vent. Thank you. \\n\\nOkay, so I just moved in June 6th with my roommate, we\\'ll call him D. D and I got along great for awhile but as time continued on true colours and intentions started to show. I am a very chaotic organized person, an art student and my room is a complete disaster however outside of my space I like to keep a tidy household in the common areas, do my dishes as I use them, clean up my messes as I go along. You know, basic human stuff. Occasionally I would let the the odd dish pile up but it would eventually get done. \\nSo D would start to become irritable, and very, very nitpicky over the smallest of things. Photo frames being on the wall and \\'cluttering\\' them. Footsteps that only showed in the right light from natural foot sweat, or dishes piled up around the sink or a laundry hamper in the bathroom with clothes in it. (Only D could have a laundry basket in there.) It was fine at first and I figured that these small super nitty gritty things would pass that it was just a phase of having a new roommate move in with D. So I just did as I told and cleaned up, did dishes etc. Mind you I did take my time with some because it did get under my skin a bit with the aggression and consistency of the reminders to clean. I started to feel like a live in maid, and started to feel like I didn\\'t have a choice in the matter. There was no talking with D, as all talking led to an inevitable \"f**k you.\" Or some form of aggression. It led to some confrontations and eventually the decision to separate our things. I had my own food cupboard D had his. Etc. Please keep in mind D still ate my food during this time. \\nWell recently I had dirtied the balcony made just a right old mess as I did my gardening and left it for a few days. Eventually a few days later I got to rearranging and cleaning the whole thing. So sometime before that D brought out a pleather stool and just left it outside, and I not thinking put a tomato on it. I left the pot on there, watered and cared for my tomatoes and as such the stool got dirty. \\nSo as I cleaned the balcony I realized \"oh this isn\\'t a table.\" So I removed my tomato, and let the stool dry out before I brought it inside. I tried to talk to D explain to them that we didn\\'t have the space nor a use for the stool and suggested we put it in the storage unit. D said if I cleaned it we\\'ll talk about it. So the next day while D was at work I took the initiative and did some house work and moved the stool to storage myself. So when D came home later and was a bit irritated that I put the stool in storage without cleaning it off and putting it in storage. I tried to explain that it could still be cleaned and still left in storage with no harm to us both and that\\'s when stuff really started to rile up. They got very, very, very aggressive and when confronted they confirmed they were angry over the stool and not getting their way. \\n\\nSo that brings us to today, D goes to work but I have plans myself to go out. So I looked at the pile of dishes and molding measuring cups and the footprints you could only see at the right angle and thought. \"F**k you.\" \\n\\nSo in the time I had before my time to leave I cleaned every dish, pot\\xa0 and glass knowing full well that I didn\\'t dirty any of them. I scrubbed the counter clean, and organized the bathroom and even mopped up those pesky footprints. At the end I didn\\'t have enough time to go into storage and wipe the stool off but I did do everything else that was demanded of me prior. I chose the high road, but remember I didn\\'t do that stool. \\nAt the end when the apartment was cleaned I took my cutest sticky note a little bee and flowers and left D a love note. (We are in no way in any sort of relationship except as roommates.)\\xa0 \"F**k you :)\" \\nI then took some hamburger of mine that I had bought but found hidden in a drawer under some apples to thaw in the fridge, gathered my stuff and left for a we\\'ll deserved girls night out. \\nRoll around to when D gets home from work and he snapchats me a handwritten note claiming I have 60 days to pack my stuff and leave, 48 if I anger him further. \\nSo, here I am sipping my wine and reveling in the thought of how I got kicked out for cleaning the apartment.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I live in S. Korea but I work for a US Company in S. Korea and because I work for an American company and I\\'m one of the few employees of my company that is American in S. Korea my company doesn\\'t issue me this letter that basically says I\\'m employed in S. Korea. \\n\\nSo this means I have restrictions on my Korean bank account. I can only withdraw 250,000 won (About $216 a day) from my Korean bank and if I go in person to a teller I can only withdraw 1 million won (about $870) a day. This normally doesn\\'t present a problem for me.\\n\\nBut...It did once. I signed a lease for a new apartment and the deposit was 10 million won (about $8,700, yes this is normal for Korea) so I transferred the money from my American bank to my Korean bank and I went to the bank in person to transfer the money to my landlord.\\n\\nI get there and the teller tells me I can only transfer 1 million per day. My first idea was to ask my landlord if she\\'d be cool with me transferring her 1 million won a day for 10 days, she doesn\\'t like that idea.\\n\\nSo I\\'m sitting there arguing and the bank manager comes out, he\\'s a nice enough man and speaks good english. Basically he says because of my type of my account there is no way I can transfer more then 1 million a day. So I need this money and I\\'m thinking and the light bulb goes off in my head.\\n\\nMe: \"If I close my account do I get my money?\"\\n\\nManager: \"Yes, we would give you the cash\"\\n\\nMe: \"And if I close my account can I open a new one?\"\\n\\nManager: \"Of course\"\\n\\nMe:\"Is there a waiting period after closing my account to open a new one\"\\n\\nManager: \"No\"\\n\\nMe: \"Fantastic, please close my account\"\\n\\nManager: \"Sure, I will need your bank book and we will destory it\"\\n\\n**Hands them my bank book and the destroy it**\\n**Signs some papers to close the account**\\n**Bank manager closes the account and gives me all the money in the account in an envelope**\\n\\nManager: \"Anything else I can help you with today?\"\\n\\n**I smile, pull out my passport**\\n\\nMe: Yes I\\'d like to open a new bank account\\n\\nBank manager looks at me, and it dawns on him what I just did, he laughs, shakes his head and goes \"Sure not a problem\"\\n\\n**I opened a new account, deposited 10,000 won and left with my deposit in my pocket**',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'On Monday, after debating for months if it was worth the cost, I bought my daughter a rather expensive toy from a certain rainforest monikered mega corp. (It was worth the cost, she loves it. That’s not the point lol)\\n\\nAs I’m walking in from work I get a push notification that “toy brands rainforest store” is up to 50% off. I check to see if the toy I bought Monday, delivered Wednesday was included. It was. And it was definitely enough money to be worth the hassle of contacting customer service to ask for a price adjustment. I’m well within the return window seeing as it was delivered 48 hours ago so I don’t see it being an issue. \\n\\nA few things to note: I am a “premium membership” customer so I have free shipping and returns. This mega corp is known to rarely if ever resell returned items. Generally it goes to their return warehouses where it is packed into grab bag lots that youtubers at one point loved to buy for “random haul” videos.\\n\\nMe: hey! I’m just looking for a price adjustment on an order I made Monday, it’s now 50% off\\n\\nCustomer Rep: I’m sorry. We here at mega corp work hard to provide the best prices for our customers at time of purchase and so we cannot provide price adjustments. \\n\\nMe: ….so you’d rather me return and rebuy the item? \\n\\nCS: yes. That would be preferred\\n\\nMe: you know that costs me nothing right? Your company will be paying to ship another toy to me, which I will not open, I will immediately get in my car and drop it at Kohl’s for return on the original order, and then you will pay for the return shipping and eat the cost of the full priced item because you don’t resell returns. Rather than simply crediting me the difference? It is exactly the same for me, you’re the one losing money. \\n\\nCS: yes. That would be acceptable. We do not do price adjustments under any circumstances. \\n\\nA new toy will be arriving tomorrow.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'A few years ago I worked as a hostess in a restaurant. We had this chef that was one of the rudest people I have ever come across. I know chefs are known for not being the nicest but boy did he deserve that cake. This man literally referred to people as R*yards if you will. Asked what race applicants were because “some work harder than others”. Someone once stole an order because a host turned her back, the person literally grabbed the bag it was in and ran right out. Things happen, he literally screamed at all hosts and said we deserve to be fired over an order. First time it even happened\\n\\n\\nAnyways as a host I did not venture into the kitchen often. I needed to stay upfront as much as possible for guests. I would come to where the door meets the kitchen to grab a server if needed. Well we weren’t technically supposed to have gum but I had coffee and was going to chew it then spit out. My bad I forgot, I’ll own it. When I was walking passed the kitchen at one point he must’ve spotted me chew. He asks me to come to where he is right outside the kitchen. I meet him there \\n\\n\\n\\nHe says: “You have gum? You know the rules. Do you not pay attention or brush your teeth?” *Laughing and smirking like he’s so clever\\n\\nMe: “yeah I have gum sorry I was going to spit it out”. \\n\\nHim: “Don’t say sorry just don’t do it?”*Mocking me at the same time\\n\\nMe: “Going to walk away to spit it out”\\n\\nHim: “No you’re not.” * He puts his hand up to my mouth, like spit here. Mind you he has not even put his gloves back on after switching them yet (No lie, I swear I was shocked lol)\\n\\nMe: “Umm you sure? You can watch me spit it in the trash can. Isn’t that like a health code violation?”\\n\\n\\nHim: *Mocking me again and now crossing his eyes too. “That’s what soap are water are for genius”\\n\\n\\nMe: * Thinking to myself that he was such a mean person to everyone I was just done with it. I already thought about putting in my two weeks anyway. So I salivate as much as I can and full blown spit into his hand. I try to make it as nasty as he is as a person\\n\\n\\nHim: *Raises his voice, “Are you serious?!” Yelling for my direct manager\\n\\nMe: * I look him in the eyes and say “That’s what soap and water are for” then walk off to my manager\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow I didn’t get fired thankfully. It was awkward working with him but my coworkers died when they heard. I did give him the option to watch me spit in the trash he didn’t like it. So I technically did what he wanted lol',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Short but sweet MC.\\n\\nI used to work in a factory canteen where I would walk for 30 minutes to arrive there for 6am. Our uniforms were to be ironed as we also served the offices upstairs.\\n\\nOne morning after my walk I ended up with a small crease (no bigger than 2 inches) at the bottom of a trouser leg, presumably from them getting caught in my trainers on my walk. My manageress sees it and tells me \"go home and iron that crease out\".\\n\\nSo I did, I went home. Ironed out the crease, applied for some new jobs and had a nap. Woke up to several interview offers and had a new job within 2 days.\\n\\nThe last contact I had with that manageress was when I texted her at 9am to tell her I would not be returning under any circumstances.\\n\\nI heard from my father (he worked in the factory at the time) that they never replaced me. They tried through agencies but nobody would ever stay longer than 2 weeks. The factory owners have since refused to renew the contract as they weren\\'t feeding enough of the staff. Guess that\\'s what happens when you send home your most experienced and best employee.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So this has been a little while coming and not entirely our new manager\\'s fault, who\\'s only been the role about 4 months. Nevertheless the guy is a bit of tool who thinks he\\'s superior and thinks his job is basically dishing out orders while everyone else does the work. How he has the time to tell me how to do my job when he can barely do his is beyond me, but nevermind.\\n\\nEssentially I\\'ve been performing above my pay grade for at least two years. The team relies on me for training and a number of skills based and advisory requests with the tasks they\\'ve been assigned. I do a lot to help and support them all, including management, while delivering my own work to a high standard.\\n\\nTwice, during annual performance reviews, previous leadership have promised me a promotion and on the basis that someone with my knowledge and skills are required to fill a gap in the team structure - basically just a step up from \\'analyst\\' to \\'senior analyst\\' if you will - nothing too radical right?\\n\\nAnyway, in year one after this promise the excuse became, \\'well pandemic is happening so we can\\'t commit to budget\\' etc. I was like fine, what can I say, higher ups aren\\'t signing if off etc. But this year it was even more obvious they\\'ve been taking advantage. \\n\\nAt this point both our big (obese) boss and my direct line manager (those making the promises) have bailed. Left the team in a really shitty position (both were quite bad leaders to be honest). Before big boss bailed, he tells me, \\'sorry your promotion is also not happening this year (even though I gave you top performance marks etc etc) because it\\'s out of my hands now... basically the position you want to be promoted to doesn\\'t exist and we can\\'t promote you because we would have to create a whole new position, which simply can\\'t be done at this stage, and in any case the company could just replace you\\'. \\n\\nOk, thanks you fat slob.\\n\\nNew line manager has been around only a couple months at this point but several months prior I\\'d agreed to take charge of training new recruits (who we desperately need because people keep leaving) and particularly because a.) I enjoy what I do and like doing a good job, and b.) I am the most senior and knowledgeable person, not just on the topics we work on but also of the company and its processes, in the team. \\n\\nProblem is new manager has hook, line and sinker swallowed the upper management\\'s bullshit. Only a few weeks ago, during a 1 to 1, he feeds me the same line. \"I understand your frustration, but we\\'d have to create a new role for you that we just don\\'t have space for\" or something to this effect. Basically we can\\'t promote you because the role you want to be promoted to doesn\\'t exist. \\n\\nSo today, about a month before new recruit joins, I basically told him that I\\'m no longer preparing the extensive library of resources for training, complete with in-depth, high quality manuals, references, helping with planning, organising and sorting out the training schedule etc. So I did the bare minimum to comply... dumped all my folders into a shared file and said, enjoy! Feel free to sort through and make of this what you will. Enjoy planning the training for a position you don\\'t even know how to do.\\n\\nI don\\'t work for free, you see, and if my role doesn\\'t exist, training and planning to this extent should fall to the supervisor and not just another analyst. Unfortunately for new guy, who is willingly inheriting all the crap that past director has left in his wake (much like I did prior), he now has to do it all himself.\\n\\nI will of course provide help in doing the actual training so that the company can\\'t hold this against me - but I certainly am not going to go any further than this. Good luck with all that work you barely understand and lack experience to do, douchebag, I hope they at least pay you enough to do it, otherwise enjoy doing it for free - after all, according to you, my role doesn\\'t exist.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Few years back I was on a camping with some friends, next to it there was a public swimming pool located. Well, we decided it would be fun to go and swim there since we all had our swimming trunks with us. \\n\\nWhen arriving at the entrance some basic rules were displayed but it said nothing about certain swimming attire required. After we all bought our tickets (about €5 if I remember correctly) we dropped our stuff somewhere on the field and went to the swimming pool. However, upon arriving there we were told no swimming trunks were allowed, and that only swim wear like speedos and square leg swimsuits were allowed. Well none of us were prepared for this and it was quite a disappointment, since the only other option was the childerens pool (there swimming trunks were allowed, but the pool was only like a feet deep. \\n\\nSo cue malicious compliance. I always like to wear my underwear under my swimming trunks (a clean one I only use for swimming) since it's more comfortable. So I decided to just go in this underwear. Normally this wouldn't have worked since they checked for underwear, as we had seen other people try going in their boxers and get denied. However my underwear has cloth very similar of that to swim suits, so it's hard to tell the difference. When I went to the pool I got checked again. The guys checking me were very skeptical I had just put on my underwear since it looked like underwear and they had just denied me for wearing swimming trunks a minute ago. However once i showed them it was indeed the same cloth as swim wear they let me pass, while still side eyeing me. \\n\\nIn the end I didn't stay for too long since my friends couldn't get in but I left with a good feeling knowing I still had gotten in :)\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I posted this a while ago and it was removed for some reason and I just remembered so I got permission to repost because I'm all about getting accolades from people I've never met.\\n\\n\\nI worked up north in oil and gas doing site facility maintenance and I started the job when the boom was happening but we soon started down the backside and cuts were made. In order to cut costs they cut our overtime, our hours, took away our flights because it was fly in and fly out and generally made life miserable.\\n\\nI could see the writing on the wall and I was an un-ticketed Carpenter so I decided to go back to school and get my JM papers. Before I went on my school break we got a new journeyman and he asked us how we can live on x amount of wages and pay for our flights as well. We told him that our wages are x + 10. The company was paying new hires about $10 an hour less than us which explained why they were trying to get people to quit so that they could replace them with cheaper labour.  I had arrangements to do 3rd and 4th year all together but as my school date was coming up they started talking about putting off my year four, fucking me around.  It took me over a year waiting to get into that class so I wasn't going to put it off. I decided to quit if they fucked me but I didn't tell them.\\n\\nSo this is near end of the calendar year and school was November/ December for year 3 and January/ February for year 4.\\n\\nThe first thing that I did was to schedule 100% of my dental benefits for December, me and my two kids.  I also scheduled whatever else we could do dentally for the new year early January.\\n\\nWe also had a Visa account that was $1,000 per year for health spending. You could use it at the dentist for whatever wasn't covered, pharmacy, optometrist those kind of things.\\n\\nSo I went to Joe's optometry and bought some sweet glasses for reading that had a picture of a horse with a guy with a stick and a little ball on it. I also got every bell and whistle for the lenses. Perfect customer.  But that's not the compliance.\\n\\nThe salesperson, bless her soul,  offered me sunglasses and I said I couldn't do that it's only for health. She told me the insurance company doesn't get itemized receipt they just see Joe's Optical for x amount of dollars. Oh yeah, I'm in with some sweet Ray bans with two pairs of polarized lenses. No problem.\\n\\nSo the company I worked for had a bunch of contracts and there were about 800 employees in total. I'd say about 60% of them were single male,  about 10% females and the rest married guys. We had a junior sparky who is all about bling so I told him he can go to the optometrist with his card and get sunglasses. I told everyone on our shift. Fuck them! Free sunglasses!!!! I might not have overtime anymore but thanks for the sunglasses.\\n\\nAnd waited.\\n\\nAnd nothing happened. I was expecting everyone to be sending messages thanking me for the loophole but nothing.\\n\\nSo I showed my sparky the receipt and my Visa card number to prove that I had done it. Next day I see him on Facebook with a new pair of sunglasses saying that he had also ordered some limited edition Ferrari sunglasses from his local optometrist.  Initially he didn’t believe me but now he was all in. I picked the sparky because he was about bling but he was also with the company since day one and he knew absolutely everyone including people on the other job sites. 800 people.\\n\\nBack to me. Because of the turnaround schedule I was scheduled to go to back to work somewhere around January 10th after they had unilaterally changed the deal.  In school we weren't allowed to miss days so my kids and I had all of our dental work done in the Christmas break on the January side. Lucky for me.\\n\\nI also asked the dentist if I could pay it forward and pay for two cleaning sessions sometime in the next year. I used our Visa health card. What was left I went back to the optometrist and I got two more pairs of sunglasses. I used up my Visa card and my yearly dental allowance in the first week of January. \\nI officially quit the day before they forced me back to work. \\n\\nMy coworkers told me middle of January there was a company-wide meeting about sweeping changes to the benefit program. They were changing companies to become more ‘streamlined’ and the benefits naturally were sharply decreased. The visa health card vanished. My guess is because they had a half a million dollar optometry bill.\\n\\nI finished school in the top three and happily had $10,000 worth of dental and $2,000 worth of sunglasses and glasses paid for in the last week of December and first week of January.\\n\\nNot only do I wear my sunglasses at night, but the future’s so bright, I gotta wear shades.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So we bought our house in 2016. Great neighborhood. It’s on a dead end street, so nice and quiet. Many of our neighbors are retired teachers who my husband has worked with as well as local cops. Have had no issues with anyone, well until just this past Sunday. \\n\\nWe just finished mowing the yard. To the right of our house is an empty lot, that is owned by the homeowner behind it ( we have no alleyway). She is now the official neighborhood Karen. Husband was using the leaf blower to get the grass clippings off of sidewalk. Karen comes storming up to him because he crossed the property line to make sure that the line is cut, which means he has mowed part of her property. This empty lot is just that, EMPTY. No trees, no flowers. Keep in mind this is the same old lady who last summer lost control of her car and instead of running into and damaging HER garage, she drove between her house and her neighbor’s house, through our backyard, hit and damaged our clothesline pole, and eventually crashed into and damaged our next door neighbor’s garage. She has never apologized or offered any compensation. \\n\\nWe today we’re mowing. Not only did we mow straight down the property line, but my husband dropped the deck on the mower so our grass is shorter than hers. Oh, did I mention her son mowed just YESTERDAY. So now Karen’s yard looks overgrown. \\n\\nEnjoy that crisp demarcation of the property line Karen.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I (24M) hosted a friend from college (also 24M) that I haven\\'t seen since before the pandemic. Shortly after he arrives we head to a local bar and grill in our neighborhood. We decided to do the 15-20 minute walk instead of drive so we didn\\'t have to worry about leaving the car. I was joined by my roommate (25M and also a good friend) and his new(ish) girlfriend (22F), who I don\\'t know that well but I have always had friendly encounters with when we have hung out.\\n\\nAt the bar drinks flowed freely and my friend seemed to really hit it off with our crew. We stayed longer than expected and it was fully dark and we were well buzzed by the time we decided to walk home. It was still hot outside when we got to the apartment complex so my roommate suggested that we hit the community pool. The pool and hot tub were technically closed for the night but it isn\\'t too close to any of the units and generally no one cares if you are responsible and don\\'t break glass bottles or anything like that. After debating whether to head back to our place to change first my roommate insisted that \"we\\'re all friends here\" and that we could all just go in the pool in our underwear. Everyone agreed on this although my roommate\\'s girlfriend announced \"you guys have fun with that\" and proceeded to lounge next to the pool on one of the deck chairs and scroll Instagram.\\n\\nWe strip down and hop in the pool and are having a pretty good time just messing around. After some time had passed my roommate was chatting with his girlfriend and then quietly approached me afterwards. Apparently his girlfriend was very uncomfortable with me wearing just briefs in the pool (both my roommate and my friend were wearing boxer briefs) and she wanted me to go all the way back to the apartment and change into a swimsuit. I initially protested and said it was his idea in the first place and how everyone was in their underwear (and none of us cared) and what\\'s the difference, it\\'s not like my underwear was white/see through or anything like that. My roommate asked me to go change for him as a favor so that it didn\\'t \"turn into an issue\" between him and her. I was pissed but decided to let it go for the time being.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the apartment an idea popped into my head when it occurred to me that I still had a swimsuit from when I used to swim on the club team in college, so I put on my speedo and head back out armed with another 6 pack for the boys in only a t-shirt, towel wrapped around my waste, and flip flops. I get back to the pool, announced I had changed into my swimsuit (as requested!), drop the towel and ditch the T, and launch into a wicked cannonball into the pool. I can see a wry smile on my roommate\\'s face but nothing else was said about my choice of attire. We go on in the pool and a few minutes later she announces that she\\'s tired and is going to bed. We stay out late including more beers and laughs in the hot tub while the girlfriend was asleep at our place.',\n",

We were back in our room at the hotel after a day of sight seeing and adventuring, and I was sitting on the couch about 2ft away from my youngest sister (5ish at the time). I asked her to “sauce me a can of cream soda”, to which she fully complied and proceeded to throw a unopened can of cream soda straight at my face. It smoked me straight in the lip and totally split my upper lip in half. I gave her the middle finger afterwards and she started to cry and I even had to apologize to her (lol). The fallout of this being my stepdad and I waiting hours in the ER before I got about 4 stitches and a swollen ass lip for the rest of the vacation. We still joke about it to this day, and I’ve never asked her to “sauce” me anything ever since.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Long time lurker first time poster. Names and small details have been changed. Sorry for formatting - I’m on mobile.\\n\\nA couple years ago I was working at a nuclear facility that was in the process of transferring historical radioactive waste to a designated dump site. \\nThe historical waste at the time had been stored in metal barrels. The process was to load the metal barrels and crush them in a designated compactor. Once crushed they were placed in large bags for transfer.\\n\\nMy job at the time was to inspect each bag for tears or holes that had been caused by the metal barrels and label them for either bag repair or re-bagging. \\n\\nAs you can imagine there were lots of issues and I was constantly tagging bags. This slowed down the process significantly and made people especially the supervisor on staff extremely angry. I had suggested we use a more durable bag to avoid these issues but the bags had already been pre-purchased and no one wanted to lose money on the process.\\n\\nThis went on for a few weeks before things started to go south. The supervisor kept putting complaints in that I was being too anal and tried to have me fired.\\n\\nFinally on my last day the supervisor came up to me and let me know that under no circumstances am I to tag a bag if the cut is under the size three inches. I tried to argue that this was unsafe and that even multiple small holes would cause the bag to fall apart. He didn’t want to hear of it so instead I radioed my normal boss Jake (I was on loan for this project) and let him know what was happening. Jake thought I was overreacting as he had reviewed all the complaints against me but ultimately confirmed with supervisor the instructions he had given me and made the supervisor send an email to Jake detailing what he had asked.\\n\\nFast forward to the end of the day. I’ve done as he has asked and the bags are now at the dump site. As they’re being offloaded via straps what do you know? They explode. EVERYWHERE. Every single last bag. \\nCue a shit storm of having to call radiation protection, the entire site being shut down, and a massive investigation into what caused the failure. \\n\\nI was quietly transferred back to my own department without repercussions and it wasn’t until months later Jake admitted I had been right.',\n",

       "  'selftext': ' \\n\\nYou guy\\'s wanted more stories about stuff I\\'ve done/dealt with, so here ya go. This takes place back in 2015, so quite awhile ago. However its still fresh in my memory when I got myself some Rally\\'s. Or Checkers, depending on where you\\'re are. I used to live in a small town, not many places to get fast food at when I lived there, and somehow two Rally\\'s had been built right across from one another on opposite sides of the road. How this happened exactly I don\\'t know, as it was like this when I moved in.\\n\\nHowever, it seems eventually whoever ran the company/whatever its called, figured this out and decided to shut one of them down. So the guy running the one being shut down was having a blowout sale, wanting to get rid of literally every food item on their menu to make their last cleanup easier before it would finally be shut down. Having heard of this a few days early due to the fact one of my friends worked there, I got there the day it was happening right as they opened. I got myself a bag of burgers and fries for literally five to seven dollars a bag, I decided to sit down and eat a single burger and fry at one of their outdoor tables before going home to stash my loot for the days to come, when this woman who surprisingly didn\\'t actually look like a Karen walked up with her kid, who was maybe, 7-9?\\n\\nThey went to order, and since a lot of people had shown up (I got there early, and a line formed rather fast) By the time they had gotten to the front counter, the place was out of fries, their fries are legendary and to die for, but the screaming fit she had when she learned her \\'precious little boy\\' couldn\\'t have his french fries? Zeus himself was likely contemplating striking her with lightning due to how loud it was. Eventually she noticed me, and my two bags. Without even trying to ask she stormed up and tried to take them, so I yanked them back as she tried. \"How can you sit there with all that when my baby is hungry! Stop being a selfish ahole and give it to my kid!\" she screeched. Had she asked nicely, I would have been more than happy to give her what she wanted, just as I was thinking to myself \\'screw it, it\\'s one fry, I\\'ll just give it to them and she\\'ll shut up and go away\\' she screeched \"For being so rude you should give us the entire bag!\" And swiped again trying to take them.\\n\\nBy this point I had decided \\'enough is enough\\' and I looked her dead in the eye, set the bag onto the ground, and JUMPED onto it with both feet. I then picked it up as she was staring in shock, and shoved it into her hands with a smile. \"Here you go, have a nice day!\" I said as I walked away afterwards with the bag of burgers I had gotten, the fries where a loss but it was nice to see her gape like a fish unable to screech anything as I walked away. Always lovely putting a Karen in their place.',\n",

       "  'selftext': ' As an avid follower of this group I have decided to weigh in with a little anecdote of myself:\\n\\nDecades ago (90s), I worked as an information researcher for a High Commissioner (HC) in an international organization (I had a junior position and was 26). During the first years, people at the Head Office started to reach out to me as well for little requests as I pride myself to be thorough and fast. Someone in the Head Office took a liking to me, so when a temporary opening at Head Office required a process analyst (which I had studied as well), I was formally requested for “secondment”. The HC complied, and off I went to a different country.  \\n\\nThe relationship between Head office and the field offices was “strained“ for various reasons, and the red tape was worse then the Byzantine Empire.\\n\\nNow the project wasn’t that interesting (record internal processes in HR and point out flaws) and less of challenge then initially presented, but it gave me a wonderful insight into the workings of the Head Office. Who decided what, en where to go when you wanted an answer or a decision. Before long, the office of the HC started to direct requests to me if they needed anything from Head Office without invoking the dreaded red tape. As a junior, this was a definite boost for my self confidence. \\n\\nA couple of weeks into my job, another international office called me, they had received “guidance”  from the HC that if they wanted anything done at Head Office, they should call me. So in the time that followed I would regularly receive calls asking me to arrange all sorts of things, which I did. In the meantime, I am still working on my project. Remember, I am still a junior.\\n\\nAnd then it all went pear shaped…\\n\\nOn a Monday morning I received a call from the Policy Director of the HC. There will be a Ministerial Conference in the town of the Head Office, but there seems to be some doubt over the hotel arrangements. If they fax me the details, would I be so kind to go to the hotel this afternoon and talk it through with the general manager? Sure. So I take the afternoon off and arrange everything.  \\n\\nThe next morning I am called into the office of my Department Director, who is furious, and my manager is standing next to him with her arms crossed. I am not allowed to sit down, and I am asked where I was yesterday afternoon. Seeing no problems, I tell them about the call and the hotel. \\n\\nThe Director then tells me, in no uncertain terms, that I am not allowed to do work for other offices whilst on the payroll for this office. If I am to lift one finger, there would be grave consequences. Furthermore, pay will be deducted for my absence yesterday. I manage to get in that I took an afternoon off and did it in my own time, but they deem it unpaid leave anyway.  \\n\\nIn comes MC.\\n\\nDejected I sit at my desk, unable to fathom what I have done wrong. Later that day I get two calls, one from HC, and one from the other office, and I inform them that by instruction of the Director I have been forbidden to do any tasks not related to my current position. Please go through regular channels. You can imagine how both reacted. The red tape in this organization is legendary. I get more calls from even higher ups in both offices, pleading me to bend the rules just a teeny bit, I mean, it is more of a guideline, wouldn’t you say? I hold my ground and suggest they need to clear it with my manager or the director, but that my hands are tied. The next day the process repeats. The Political Director calls concerning the conference, can I contact translators and go through the flight plan of the HC and staff with the limo company? “No” . “What?”, and I repeat my mantra. He gets furious and starts shouting. Not at me, but the general incompetence of Head Office, with some choice words about certain directors there.  \\n\\nThe next morning my manager’s secretary walks into my office. She is nervous. “Please report to the Secretary Generals (SG) office immediately”. The tone lets me know something horrible is afoot. So I actually ran there. The SG’s secretary greets me with a malicious grin. “Oh, you have created quite a mess, have you?” I still don’t know what’s going on, but could see my immediate termination in a not so distant future…\\n\\nAs I walk in, there is the SG, my Director and my manager. The SG is fuming. He explains to me that a formal complaint is being prepared by the HC and the Head of the other office over the lack of service from the Head Office. Whereby the HC had even hinted that the department was trying to derail a Ministerial Conference. This all due to the fact that “it had come to their attention” that people have been directly instructed not to assist the two offices. “ Is this true?” “Yes, I have been told that I am not allowed to perform any duties for any other office while on the payroll of this office”.\\n\\nWith me present the SG looks at both and asks “which idiot has decided this?” The Director states that he decided this based on the information from my manager. The SG tells him “Well, this morning I have been shouted at by the HC and the Head of Office from the other office, and I don’t like being shouted at.” He looks at me and tells me “Whenever you receive a request from those offices, I want you to execute these with priority and diligently. This overrides your assignment. If there is any discussion refer to my office. However, you will report to me weekly on the nature of these requests. My office will confirm this in writing.” I nod, say thank you and get out of there. Inside, shouting ensues. The secretary winks at me with a broad smile: “a right mess, it is”. My head is spinning. Part of my work now falls under the direct supervision of the SG.\\n\\nFrom that time on, to the end of my secondment I basically could do whatever I wanted. I attended the conference at the personal request of HC and did everything that was asked of me. I continued to receive calls from the various offices and ran errands for the SG office. I even went to other countries to have meetings there at the request of offices.   \\n\\nI finished the project ahead of time, and became a go to person for a lot of people (even when I returned to my own office).  After I got back to my office I received an immediate pay rise, new tasks, and a number of wonderful letters of recommendation (the HC and Political Director had personally asked for them), which helped tremendously when I changed positions years later. Although the HC has long since passed I still remember him fondly as a man who had your back, no matter how junior or lowly your position.   \\n\\nTLDR: seconded to a head office of an international organisation I became a way of circumventing red tape. When stopped this was escalated to the highest level and I got a free pass.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Another post about someone’s experience as a temp reminded me of my own experience. So in the late 90’s, I was hired as a temp for the summer at a company that provided store brand credit cards. My sister and her friend were also hired so we were able to commute together. The two of them worked in data entry and I was assigned to help in the research department. \\n\\nOverall, it was a well run place and everyone was generally friendly and nice. My boss was pretty good but she didn’t really know what to do with me. My first day she sat me next to a full time woman in the research dept. \\n\\nOur job was when someone called the call center disputing a charge, the agent would take the information and the research department would reach out to the store to get a copy of the signed receipt. \\n\\nThe other woman would call the stores to request they pull the signature slip, but if they were too busy to help, we would fax the request for them to fax back the signed copy. I still don’t know why we couldn’t just email the request, but we had to fax it. \\n\\nThere was quite a backlog of faxes to make when I started. So I would create a request page in MS word with what we needed (date, amount, register number) and provided a fax number for them to send it to us. \\n\\nHowever, our fax machine was AWFUL. Remember this is the late 1990’s and tech was improving but often still clunky. The fax had a memory that would hold like 6 pages. It would also take 2.5 minutes per page to send. The fax machine was not close to me. It was probably 50 yards away right outside the bosses window. \\n\\nSo after the first day, I decided to print six requests, go load the six faxes to memory so they would send and then go back to my desk and generate another batch of new requests and deal with any other tasks or emails in the 15 minutes it took for the first batch to go through. Usually when I would go back to the fax machine, we’d have a response or two from the stores that my coworker could process. \\n\\nAfter about an hour of this pattern, our boss decided I was just screwing around because I wasn’t right next to the fax actively processing another fax at all times. She was very concerned about getting through this backlog as quickly as possible. I tried to explain that I was being more productive and I was using the memory function on the fax to its fullest, so there wasn’t any additional productivity to be had. She wasn’t buying it, so she said “stop wasting time going back and forth. I want you to generate all the request pages at once, then sit next to the fax and send them all.”\\n\\nOkay, boss. It’s a waste of time, but you got it. So every day I would spend the day next to the fax machine. As soon as I saw that memory was less than 80% full, I’d queue up another fax to go. It was excruciatingly dull. \\n\\nUnfortunately, because the fax machine was getting no breaks other than my lunch breaks, none of the stores could send us back their signed slips unless they did it after hours. So not only was I less productive, but my coworker was also unable to do as much because we weren’t getting responses since the fax line was always busy. \\n\\nFinally after a week I was done. But, because so many stores hadn’t replied, I was asked to repeat the process for all the ones who hadn’t replied. Which was most of them. But since I figured out what was going on, I stopped filling up the memory on the fax and would just send a fax and then wait a minute after it was done sending before I sent again. I just pretended I was waiting for the memory to free up and the boss didn’t notice. We were much more successful that week than the first. \\n\\nAfter that, we caught up and the job became much more interesting and the boss much more reasonable and good to work with. It turns out her boss had been riding her on not making more progress on dispute resolution. It wasn’t until the end of the summer that I told her again what a waste that first week was. She was able to laugh about it then and apologized for giving me such a miserable first two weeks.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'As my sister and I grew up, my mom stayed single. She had no other sources of income other than my sister and I working to pay for our own stuff as best we could.\\n\\nMy mom had left her job working for the school system to finish college (after the divorce). After she got her degree (now mandatory for working for the school system) they let her know she lost her job, seniority and tenure. \\n\\nSo she got a job at a big company- as a customer service rep.\\n\\nPeople would call in all the time saying they didn’t make this one 400 dollar charge (to a specific and unique place) ( but didn’t dispute the other 10).\\n\\nBig company x was horrible to their employees. When my mom would get home she would wave her hand at us and just let us know she couldn’t talk to us - for maybe an hour because her day was that bad. One of the ladies she worked with frequently couldn’t make it to the restrooms in time. When they moved the call center they had to throw that ladies chair out. So you can see, it was a bit of a sweat shop but my mom was afraid of not getting her pension so she never moved or made a peep. Honestly moms kind of passive anyway, so she wouldn’t think of making waves.\\n\\nThey moved the call center to a different state. Then… they started imposing new rules on a weekly basis. Sales rules and quotas for the customer service reps.  Mom- never the pushy person started doing poorly. Right around that time she went out for surgery on one knee and heel. \\n\\nShe was out for at least a month. \\n\\nShe came back to some horrific sales quotas imposed for the customer service reps. All she had to do was last 2 more months for 20 years of service and a pension… but she was one week away from getting fired because she couldn’t make the sales quotas.\\n\\nGood thing she had to have her knee replaced on the other leg too… she went out and the doctor wrote her out for 2 months. She came back to no call center (moved to a different country), and being able to retire with full pension and full health benefits.\\n\\nMoral: oh try to screw me out of my pension? I’ll get pension and benefits and 2 new knees!\\n\\nDon’t mess with my mom.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Not my story but my father’s. This happened about 20-30 years ago in a developing country. \\n\\nMy dad used to work for the government as one of the engineering managers for one section of the railway. \\n\\nAn expansion on the railway track in his section had started and my father was assigned to deal with the construction planing. \\n\\nOne day he was dealing with one of the contractors for the construction and he wasn’t convinced by the contractor’s price. My dad new very well his trade and he could see that the contractor was trying to over price him in order to pocket on government’s funds. My dad had an upper hand of the situation and didn’t give in to the contractors price, offering to pay a much lower price instead or else signing with another company. \\n\\nThis contractor apparently was not too good at negotiations, and spent the rest of the negotiation asking for a hand from my dad and implying that “one hand washes the other” within government businesses. \\n\\nNow, it’s important to say that my father and the contractor were walking along the railroad while having this conversation. \\n\\nIt’s also important to say that this track they were on crossed through a very dangerous neighbourhood controlled by a drug cartel. This cartel was known for harshly retaliating against criminals in their area cause they didn’t want cops showing up and messing up with their business. One known retaliation against robbery was cutting off the robbers’ right hand. \\n\\nYou probably can see where this is going now. While walking along the railroad the contractor started to get very irritated demanding my father to give him a hand with the price. Coincidentally, when my father looks at the ground he sees a severed hand. That wasn’t the first time he had seen that so without skipping a beat my dad grabbed the hand and tossed on the contractors direction saying that he could have it. \\n\\nThe contractor had a mix of confusion, shock, and disgust on his face that my father always laughs when remembering this story. Apparently having a hand thrown at was enough to make the contractors see it was futile to negotiate and he signed on my father’s much lower offer.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Last post seemed to be take well so here is another during my college years when I worked is sales. \\n\\nI worked for a company selling furniture. The company had regular sales staff like me and had a special section called the design gallery. \\n\\nThe design gallery was for the very high end furniture that was always custom made to order and had select staff trained to sell it called designers.  Regular sales people could not sell out of the design gallery but the designers could sell whatever they want. Designers made a good salary + commission and the normal sales staff made just commission. The design galley also had fancy wood flooring so it was easy to realize when you stepped foot into that area. \\n\\nNow displayed all over the floor including the design gallery would be fake plants, lamps, artwork, and small stuff that was overpriced, had good margin, and played great comission. So sales people would have to walk their customers through design at times when showing customers accessories. For example furniture would pay 2% but these accessories would pay 10-20%  \\n\\nAt some point this angered the design staff and after some complaining a new rule was introduced that the regular sales staff could no longer sell out of the design gallery period and would need to hand off their customer if they wanted something. \\n\\nThis made no sense to us and we largely ignored the rule as we didn't sell actual furniture out of the gallery. A few weeks later management followed up on the rule and threatened to take away any sell we made out of the gallery. So if I sold 2k in furniture in my area but sold a $50 fake plant displayed in the gallery I would have the whole sale taken from me. \\n\\nAt this point we decided to follow these rules to the letter. Any time a customer wanted to look at anything sitting on that fancy wood floor we called over a designer to help out. Have a question about a $30 lamp? Let me get someone to help you out. want to know if that $60 fake plant comes in a smaller size?  I'll get someone to help you out. We made a habit of standing near the gallery so we could call a designer to help out any customer that looked like they had a question. \\n\\nIf you have ever been in sales you would know most of these customers never bought a thing. I think the designers were hoping for easy sales off our hard work but they were pissed about being called over for every little thing. \\n\\nWhat's even better is a majority of customers after being told we would have to get them someone else to help with that item in the design gallery just decided they didn't need it so it actually hurt sales. \\n\\nIt took several months but after all the complaints and a drop in total month end margin, they adjusted the rule to we cant sell designer furniture but everything else was fine.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hello. I just told a story in Idontworkherelady and this one is kinda related to it. Kinda. \\n\\nAnyway. I work in very large community center that is non-proffit. We have tons of stuff. Like children daycare, open college, physiotherapy for seniors and disabled people. We got 6 huge apparment building for senior citizens trough out the city, activities for immigrants and unemplyeed. We got cafeteria and a restaurant. And more. \\n\\nNow. I love my work. I got promotion after promotion. I started and IT-tech support person. I was the only IT guy in whole organization. When I started we got like maybe 80 persons working there including the teachers in our open college. ( today we are over 200 strong )\\n\\nSo anyway. It\\'s relaxed and non toxic work enviroment. As I got tons of work to do as I am alone with everything that runs with ones and zeros, I have to plan my work al little different than rest of the bunch. So I have 100% flexible work times meaning I work when I see fit. I am on salary. They pay me once a month and not hourly. The Executive director approves this as I can maintain the whole organisations it-infrastrucure without any downtime. I come and go as I see best for me doing my job.\\n\\nThis worked fine for about 12 years or so. Everyone was happy and I was respected because not only I got the job done but my job did not cause any downtime on IT at all. Only downtime was hour or less if some ones workstation brokedown etc. I always had spared ready to go. I also was 24/7 on call and went to the office in middle of my vacations if needed and I was able to go. \\n\\nI worked on weekends and sometimes nights on work week just to get things done so there is no downtime at office hours. \\n\\nThat time in my career we had pretty massive amount of servers. 8 server machines just for microsoft stuff. 4 Linux servers and couple BSD\\'s for open college. I had a maintance routine divided to small maintanance that I did after office hours and large maintanance that I did after office hours and contineud trough the night and the huge ones that needed me to live at the office over the weekend. \\n\\nAnd as there was no thing as \"overtime\". We had agreement that when ever I had to work more than 8 hours, I would get payed leave instantly on next day. So if I came work at 8 in the monday, stayed untill everyone left and then started the smaller maintanence that would usually take like 2-3 hours max, I would then come 2-3 hours later to work next day. And if it took long enough, I could take the whole next day off. I always informed the whole organisation that maintanance was due and I would deal with it and take x amount of leave next day. \\n\\nNo problems with any one. Business as usual untill....\\n\\nWe hire a new project manager. Middle aged lady than has most piercing blue eyes that drill into our soul and suck all the joy and will to live out of you. And she was a corporate manager.   \\nIt was her first time working in non-profit org so she was super shocked how relaxed our office was. \\n\\nThere was complaints about everything that I don\\'t want to list here because only one is relevant. \\n\\nWorking times.\\n\\nI did not get how she was able to boss around out frigging Director when she was only a project manager. I mean wtf. I was at that time already a Systems Administrator.\\n\\nBut anyway. Soon came the time for large maintanence. Some updates for accounting software and some smaller things to open college end. I put a notice to our org\\'s e-mail list like always and state that large updates are going in starting this evening and ending before tomorrow morning.   \\nAnd that I would not be in office next day. E-mail me or call if any problems.   \\nI never gave any time estimates because there was always a chance that they wont hold. If something goes wrong with updates of other stuff, it\\'s my ass who has to fix it anyway and then it\\'s god know how many hours it takes.\\n\\n So evening comes, everybody goes home and I wait till last one logout from their workstation and go to work. Routine stuff. Some updates. weird database conversion that has to be done everytime our accounting or wages software gets an update. it takes time but only like 6 hours or so as it\\'s only the accounting database. \\n\\nI finish my stuff and head home.\\n\\nNext morning I wake up around 07.00. Make some coffee and head to my gaming computer and think. \"Ah, all day nothing but eve online. )\\n\\nAt around maybe 09.something my work phone rigns. I ansver and it is the project manager. I\\'ll just call her PMS from now. \\n\\nPMS yells to me on the phone. ( something like this, dont remember actual words)\\n\\nPMS:\"Where the hell are you?\"  \\nMe:\" At home, it\\'s my day off\"  \\nPMS:\" Oh. well we have a situation here. I need you here now!\"  \\nMe:\" Ok. Ill be there in 15minutes.\" I still lived pretty close to my work. \\n\\nOn my way I thought that did I fcuk up something last night? Can\\'t be. I tested everything and it would have been accounting calling me or secretary if it was about updates at open college end. \\n\\nWell what ever. Ill see then.\\n\\nI rush to office and go straight to project managers office. \\n\\nMe:\" Hey whats up?\"  \\nPMS:\" My printer is out of toner. Get me a new one\"  \\nMe: \" ?!?!? o\\\\_O Out of toner? It this the situation? There is toners on a shelf at storage at 1st floor. All desktop printers are the same and use same toner so why did you not get it your self? All this was explained to you a week ago.\"  \\nPMS: \" I am not going to change any toners boy, do your job!\"   \\nMe: \" Ok what ever\" and head to storage to get new toner.   \\nWe have a policy that all employeers deal with their own desktop printers. Like add papers to them and change the toner because it is as easy to putting your effing shoes on.   \\nAnd it takes these trivial tasks away from me who already is overworked and underpayed. \\n\\nI got back and change the toner. Then I head back home. \\n\\nShe actually stopped her whining for awhile and I thought all was good. \\n\\nBut after couple more maintanance days and night she called a administrative meeting. \\n\\nSo there were me, our new wages clerk who also was HR manager, director, office manager and PMS.\\n\\nPMS starts the meeting. ( again something like this as I dont remember the actual words )\\n\\nPMS: \" I wanted to talk about work times and how \"OP\" has been slacking and taking leave on his own accord. I thought that in this community we all share the same rules do we not?\"\\n\\nMe: \" Sorry but as the same rules do apply to all, work times don\\'t. We do different kinda work here so same exact works times just wont work.\"\\n\\nPMS: \" You have been at home when people here have problems with their computer\" \\n\\nMe: \" Yes and they call me if there is a problem and 99.9% of time we get it sorted out by phone.\"\\n\\nPMS: \" But your home is not your workplace. Your office is.\"\\n\\nMe: \" Yes but as I have to work late and even nights sometimes here, I take the payed leave asap like we have agreed here\"\\n\\nPMS: \" Well ALL work should be done at normal office hours. Why do you even have to work at nights or weekends\"\\n\\nMe: \" Because no one here want\\'s any downtime on theirs work\"  \\n\\n\\nJust to clarify. There were at this point maybe 120 people strong. at least 80 of those used workstations or laptops for their work. Even the damn fitness instructors. Everything was at this point digital and ran ones and zeroes. Physisits meets a client, they do their stuff and then physisists does the mandatory report on computer. They make all the plans for clients on computer. Kiddie daycare uses computers daily to be contact with parents etc.   \\nEverything is ran by computers now. \\n\\nPMS: \" Nonsense. You can do your job at office hours like the rest of us.\"  \\n\\n\\nI look at director as I know HR and office manager don\\'t give a flip about this.   \\nAnd for some reason director says to me\\n\\nDirector: \" Yeah, PMS and I have been talking about this issue for few times now with whole staff and from now on our old agreement is no longer valid. You have to do all your work at office hours. Many people don\\'t like that you can take payed leave\"\\n\\nMe: \" Are you sure. Like 110% sure about this. All my work. Server and network maintanance too? at Office hours? Can we make new written agreement on this like we did on my open hours?\"\\n\\nDirector: \" Yes. Comeby at evening before we close the office for today, I\\'ll have the agreement ready by then\" \\n\\nMe: \"Okay dokey\" and leave do continue what ever I was doing before this crap-is-about-to-hit-the-fan meeting. \\n\\nAs you can guess what is about to happen.... har har har.\\n\\nI mean there was zero toxicity at out work. Everyone was happy and then. Argh. One corporate goblin just has to some and create this tension. \\n\\nOh well. They are about to learn their lesson.\\n\\nI go to see director later at evening and we sign the agreement about my new work times.   \\nI check the agreement and tell director that he forgot something. There is no mention about the timeframe I need to inform whole staff when maintanence is about to happen. Only that I have to do all my work at office hours. from 8.15  to 15.30  \\nAlso. As I am on salary. Over time is not allowed unless we have an agreement on it. And whoopsie, old agreement that stated my overtime hours would be payed leave hour by hour, new agreement had nothing about overtime. So absolutely no overtime hours. Period! But I did not mention this to him.\\n\\nHe just shurgs his shoulders and says\\n\\n\" Just send them email in the morning if you are about to do it that day\" \\n\\nAllll righty then! Will do.\\n\\nIll just start to my waiting game. I love my work and all the people here but Im about to make my self most hated man here, at least for a while. \\n\\nCouple of weeks go by. I do few small maintanance jobs here and there and down time is only from one hour to 2 and I usually do it at luch time so everyone get as little down time possible. \\n\\nBecause I am waiting for the huge one. \\n\\nAnd patience of rewarded. In a few months, accounting and wages are getting huge updates.  I mean this is the stuff that usually means that I stay whole weekend at office sleeping on the floor with sleeping bag for those couple of hours I can.  \\nI still think that should I just to go and tell the director that we are about to hit the big one. Nope. Im not. \\n\\nI also had saved some smaller updates just for this occasion. Buahahah. I have never felt so evil in my life. \\n\\nSo the day comes and I go to office 8.15 sharp and send the message to whole organization.\\n\\n\"Good morning. It\\'s xx.xx.20xx and today is again maintanance day. Prepare for some downtime. This maintanance concerns whole organizations as I have to update all the servers and some routters too. There is also a huge update on Financial software and it is critical and has to be done.   \\nI will start operation at 11.00 as usual. Thank you for your understanding.   \\nSinceraly - OP\"\\n\\nRemember that I never have told anyone any estimates how long maintanence will take. heh heh....\\n\\nI do my other stuff and then ding ding it\\'s 11.00.  \\n\\n\\nTime to start.   \\nPhase one. First I kick every employee out from network. Easy. I got a script for that.   \\nPhase two. Then I hit OS updates on EVERY server and go get some coffee. \\n\\nNow, everyone got kicked out from network so they can\\'t access anything at network. Fileserver is offline. Print server, offline, database servers, offline. They cant even use photocopier because you have to logged to AD (Active directory) to use it with rdif card.  \\nThey still have access to their desktop and they can use desktop applications but as company policy, ALL data is stored to file servers as no one is allowed to save any files on their laptops and workstations. \\n\\nAlso they can\\'t use internet at all because every server is now downloading updates from internet. And I made sure every linux and unix box downloads everything possible.\\n\\nMy phone starts to ring. \\n\\nMe\" This is IT services. How can I help.\" \\n\\n\\\\~Screaming\\\\~\\n\\nMe \" Yeah it\\'s a big maintanance today. I did send email this morning about it. No I don\\'t know how long it\\'s\\' gonna take. All day at least. maybe. We see.\" Click on the other end.\\n\\n12.00 People are starting to return from lunch. Whole network is still down and stays down.   \\n13.00 ish. I start to get phonecalls about how long it\\'s gonna take. Some people come to my office when they can\\'t reach me by phone. I just tell that estimated time is unknown on these big updates. Should not take more than day or two.\\n\\nDay or two. This is what stirred the whole place. It was like a beehive all the sudden. People came to me screaming and yelling. \"Why you do dis to us\" WHYYYYYY\"   \\n\"Cancel the updates now. I need to work\" \"Stooooooop\"\\n\\nI just shrug my shoulders. Sorry. Can\\'t do anything about it. It\\'s impossible to cancel or stop once it is put into motion. Just hang on. \\n\\nEven director came to see me and was first angry and then little confused. I told that this is what maintanance is. It is what it is and nothing will  change it. At least not this instant. Everyone just has to suck it up and wait till it\\'s done. Im just doing my JOB here.\\n\\nSo I just read some IT magazines and had too much coffee for the rest of the day as I was waiting for the servers to update. Then 15.30 came and I went home. Some people were still sitting at their offices waiting and looked me with the most questionable faces asking where I am going. \\n\\n\"Home, see you tomorrow\"\\n\\nNext day. I go check the servers at the morning. Almost done all of them. Unix and Linux are peachy. I still have to reboot all the windows servers. I do that. I could just boot them all at once but I feel more evil by the minute and I just boot them one at the time, waiting for server to fully boot, me login and check that updates are ok before moving to next one. And of course. After every server, I pull my own laptop and make a maintanance report in detail. ( no one reads these reports but office managers demands them anyway?! o\\\\_O They go straight to archive and into recycle bin year later)\\n\\nAfter I have done with servers, clock is around almost 14.00, and I haven\\'t had my lunch yet so I go and have a lunch. I come back 15.10 and start to plan next day. I need to install updates for financial applications and I want to do checklist that all goes smoothly. Did not complete my list and plan so its 15.30 again and Im going home. \\n\\nDid I mention that its now thursday. I started my maintance at tuesday. oopsie :)\\n\\nI finish my checklist and plan for financial software updates early. I start dropping updates one by one before lunch time. I could drop them all at once but I just want to go by the book and follow my check list. Its by the way recomended by the this software supplier that updates are installed one by one.\\n\\nAll goes smooth and I put the databases to do their weird conversion. As I am not a total manpart, I drop rest of smaller updates on other serverside prorgams while I wait for the database thingy to complete. Well as usual, it takes forever so I head back home when clock hits 15.30.\\n\\nFriday. I have been only person in our 120 person company working since 11.00 last tuesday. Everyone is so pissed. They have to come to office and do nothing. Some are doing cleaning operations to their desk. Some are tidying paper archives etc. Most are just sipping coffee and reading magazines.   \\nInternet has been fine since wensday but I don\\'t think any one has noticed. Lol.\\n\\nI feel sorry for physisists who have to use pen and paper to all clienst and then laters sort everything on their computers. Restaurant and cafeteria are fine as I did not mess with cashier systems at all. \\n\\nFriday morning and I get all ok from database conversion. Ok. lets see. Hmmm. ok. I think I can now begin starting the SERVICES on servers. One by one of cource. \\n\\nI take my sweet time. Using every brake I am entitled to and have full lenght lunch break. \\n\\nFinaly. 15.00 sharp I send an email to whole org that maintanance is now done and you can now relogin to get access to network. Thank you for your patience. Next estimated huge maintanance is about in 3 or 4 months. \\n\\nDirector, office manager, accoutant and wages clerk had been at home most of the week. I think I was them at wensday morning and but not after that. Project manager was pissed at wensday too but left me alone as I explained that If I have to go to some meetings with every branch about this downtime issue, downtime would only get longer as I would not be actively working on it. \\n\\nNext week we had new administration meeting and my old open twork times agreement with overtime leave was active again. I got in written. \\n\\nNo one ever complained about my payed overtime freetime ever again. \\n\\nAnd I was not conserned about getting fired as in my country, firing employee is hard. It is super hard to get rid of some one. And as I had written agreement about worktimes and my work contract clearly stated what I do at my work, there was no way they could have any case of sacking my temoraly evil ass. \\n\\nBut in the end all was good. Couple of weeks and everyone is happu to work again, with no downtime at all.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Not my MC, something I witnessed about 14 years ago.\\n\\nAt the time, I was working at a factory producing interior parts for semi-trucks. Not mechanical parts, but things like seat covers and upholstered panels. We worked with a lot of spray adhesives, and the ventilation system was not up to the task of keeping the air clear, so there was a lot of glue floating around in the air. \\n\\nNaturally, this glue builds up on equipment. It is not a problem because the equipment we use gets cleaned on a regular basis. What doesn't get cleaned for eight months out of the year is the heating system. It builds a massive layer of glue from Spring to Fall.\\n\\nNow, our maintenance guys know this, and they are not stupid, so the rule is to turn the heating system on Friday evening. It burns off all the glue over the weekend and is fine by Monday morning.\\n\\nBut then we got this new maintenance supervisor, we will call him NS. Not a bad guy in general, but new to being management and NOT from our company. About a month after NS started, it was a bit chilly on a Thursday morning, so he orders the maintenance guys to turn the heating system on.\\n\\nOf course, they tried to explain that they couldn't do that. Hell, they even tried to get the plant manager involved, but he had left early. So, NS insisted they listen to him and turn the system on, and finally they did.\\n\\nTwenty minutes later, we are evacuating the building, the haze of burning glue fumes is so thick that you cannot see more than ten feet inside and two people are going to the hospital for severe asthma attacks. The rest of us are stuck standing/sitting in the parking lot for three hours, in hopes that the cloud will clear enough for us to go back to work, before they finally say we can leave. Plus, the truck factory we supplied had to shut down for four hours the next morning so we could get the parts they needed to them.\\n\\nNS did not get fired, but the plant manager advised him to listen a little more and talk a little less until he got to know how things worked.\\n\\nTLDR: New maintenance supervisor insists on heating being turned on, causes evacuation and shutdown.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Awhile ago when I was working at a sushi restaurant as a sushi chef, the owner had it in his mind that too many customers were canceling their add-on orders and he was losing out on those sales, so he required all the sushi chefs and kitchen cooks to make the add-on orders first before we start a new order.  This, being a  sushi restaurant, almost everybody adds on orders. You typically order a few things then order more and more. Its a multi-course meal, as opposed to something like a burger joint where you order your burgers and fries in one go and that's that.\\n\\nQueue my MC. I knew this was a terrible idea, and being one to enjoy watching things crash and burn, I complied to the T. \\n\\nThis happened everyday, every shift but here is a typical example: \\n\\nTable 1 orders a few items, some sushi pieces and a roll.  Table 2 and 3 order as well and I'm making a few things from each table at the same time and im about 75% done with table 1 and 25% done with tables 2 and 3. Table 1 adds on a few more rolls which I know will take me about 20 minutes. Table 2 and 3 have been waiting about 20 minutes already and have only received 25% of their food.  \\n\\nAs per the owner's direct order, I start making table 1's add-on order so that they don't cancel it.  It takes 20 minutes and I send it. Now table 4 has put in a new order and im just getting back to finishing table 2 and 3's order. 20 minutes pass and I've finished about 75% of table 2 and 3. They have now been waiting 1 hour and have not yet received all their food. I haven't started on table 4. Table 1 orders more rolls. Again, im doing what my boss has explicitly told me and I start making table 1's add-on-add-on order which takes me another 10 minutes. It has been 70 minutes and table 2 and 3 haven't received all their food yet.  Table 2 adds on some more and table 3 now wants the rest of their food canceled if I haven't started it.  Table 4 has canceled everything and left. \\n\\nThis happened just about every dinner rush and the owner still didn't realize the error on his ways.\\n\\nAnother story is that one time the owner was helping me make sushi.  Table 1 ordered and I was making that ticket. Table 2 ordered and the owner was making that ticket.  Table 2 added on orders before he had even sent anything from table 2 and he grabs the ticket from the printer and tells me to make it first. I try to tell him that he was making table 2's first order and it hadn't gone out yet but he insisted I make table 2's add on first. I make it quickly and send the add on order. About an hour passes after several add ons from other tables and table 2 finally gets their initial order.\",\n",

I kept pushing them for a good week or two but the old guy (CEO) kept delaying with no intentions to provide me one.\\n\\nSo I told them that I wont be coming to the office and will be working from home given its covid times anyways and the fact that its my personal device.\\n\\nA week later that parent company CEO called me to the office to discuss something else but also asks me directly, why have I not being coming to the office. I told him that I wont bring my device everyday to damage it further as I should be given one a long time ago, he started arguing and I went back n fourth with him while everyone watched with their jaws dropped. \\nIt wasnt shouting but aggressive tone with loud voices than normal from the both of us. \\n\\nAt the end of it all, he said \"dont give me that attitude and if you dont like it here, then you can leave\". Others jumped in, calmed the situation but I made my mind to comply. \\n\\nAs soon as I received the paycheck 3-4 days later, I resigned and wrote a letter to everyone explaining how pathetic his leadership was.\\nTurns out 2 other guys resigned with me as well in protest to his ways. \\n\\nThe project deadline got totally screwed, they couldnt find any UX designer to continue, more developers left as well, their investor backed out seeing their performance and inability to meet the deadline, they had to shut it all down, couldnt even pay the office rent.\\n\\nThat young founder still contacts me to offer projects from time to time as I was pretty good at freelancing before and after this job. \\n\\nPretty satisfying.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So, I\\'ve been working a crappy temp job in Customer Services since March, and I\\'ve experienced a whole world of problems.\\n\\n - firstly, I didn\\'t get paid until the end of April because my contract wasn\\'t given to me in time to make payroll despite me starting on March 2nd;\\n\\n  - my hours were originally agreed to be me leaving 45 mins early (4:30pm) due to an evening job. The manager had agreed on this with me, with a view to changing it eventually but with appropriate notice. She then decided, literally a week after I first got paid, that she wanted me working from 11am til 7pm. Apparently, this was always the plan but I had just been told and she implied that failing to rearrange everything would lead to my dismissal;\\n\\n- I was made to disclose why my bathroom breaks were 14 mins and not the allotted 10 (I have real bad IBS but didn\\'t really want co-workers knowing that);\\n\\n- being told, explicitly, not to speak to her directly about issues, then getting it in the neck for not coming to her directly about things;\\n\\n- my shifts were again changed so that I worked regular hours on Tuesdays (meaning I could play evening football) until... They weren\\'t. I was then expected to wait for the evening floor plan (sent out at 5pm) to find out what times I would be working the next day.\\n\\nThis last one, coupled with the manager\\'s awful micromanaging and abhorrent behaviour (she calls the general public \"the great unwashed\" and regularly refers to a member of staff as \"the Italian\" instead of by his name) made me snap. I told my supervisor that I wouldn\\'t be doing 11-7 the following day when I was given the floor plan at 5pm. Cue a meeting with the Fuhrer.\\n\\nShe proceeded to basically sack me, saying she didn\\'t see any point in me working there longer than the month, to which I replied \"okay, cool.\" Which, I think, shocked her. On my part, I have another job to walk into, a \\'proper\\' job starting in Jan, and I don\\'t pay rent, so I don\\'t *need* the job like others do. She said I\\'d be working the shitty shift until the month was done. Coolio.\\n\\nFlash forward and the month has passed and she hasn\\'t even given me my notice. I\\'m still turning up and still getting paid. However, I do the bare minimum for one part of my job (answering calls) and precisely nothing for the other part (emails: haven\\'t answered one since what would have been my final day).

       "  'selftext': 'So, I\\'ve been working a crappy temp job in Customer Services since March, and I\\'ve experienced a whole world of problems.\\n\\n - firstly, I didn\\'t get paid until the end of April because my contract wasn\\'t given to me in time to make payroll despite me starting on March 2nd;\\n\\n  - my hours were originally agreed to be me leaving 45 mins early (4:30pm) due to an evening job. The manager had agreed on this with me, with a view to changing it eventually but with appropriate notice. She then decided, literally a week after I first got paid, that she wanted me working from 11am til 7pm. Apparently, this was always the plan but I had just been told and she implied that failing to rearrange everything would lead to my dismissal;\\n\\n- I was made to disclose why my bathroom breaks were 14 mins and not the allotted 10 (I have real bad IBS but didn\\'t really want co-workers knowing that);\\n\\n- being told, explicitly, not to speak to her directly about issues, then getting it in the neck for not coming to her directly about things;\\n\\n- my shifts were again changed so that I worked regular hours on Tuesdays (meaning I could play evening football) until... They weren\\'t. I was then expected to wait for the evening floor plan (sent out at 5pm) to find out what times I would be working the next day.\\n\\nThis last one, coupled with the manager\\'s awful micromanaging and abhorrent behaviour (she calls the general public \"the great unwashed\" and regularly refers to a member of staff as \"the Italian\" instead of by his name) made me snap. I told my supervisor that I wouldn\\'t be doing 11-7 the following day when I was given the floor plan at 5pm. Cue a meeting with the Fuhrer.\\n\\nShe proceeded to basically sack me, saying she didn\\'t see any point in me working there longer than the month, to which I replied \"okay, cool.\" Which, I think, shocked her. On my part, I have another job to walk into, a \\'proper\\' job starting in Jan, and I don\\'t pay rent, so I don\\'t *need* the job like others do. She said I\\'d be working the shitty shift until the month was done. Coolio.\\n\\nFlash forward and the month has passed and she hasn\\'t even given me my notice. I\\'m still turning up and still getting paid. However, I do the bare minimum for one part of my job (answering calls) and precisely nothing for the other part (emails: haven\\'t answered one since what would have been my final day). I\\'ve also instructed my supervisor that I won\\'t be doing Tuesday evenings anymore (I\\'m good with the rest cos this job pays better than my other one). He told me she expects me to do em. My (incredibly satisfying) response:\\n\\n\"Cool. She can expect that.\"\\n\\n\"So you\\'re doing them?\"\\n\\n\"No, but she\\'s free to expect it.\"\\n\\nI\\'m now awaiting the inevitable \\'chat\\' where I\\'ll be sure to tell her that she\\'s had plenty of notice of my intentions not to do this shift, I haven\\'t told her directly because it was made clear to me that all my communication would be with my supervisor, and that I shouldn\\'t still be in the job anyway and I\\'m only still here because of her incompetence and the rest of the team (who I love) having too much to do.\\n\\nBuzzing for that one.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This is my Dad’s story and from about 40 years ago. \\n\\nOne day he came home stressed out and Mom asked what happened…\\n\\nHe was a forklift operator at a fruit processing plant. Drivers often told Dad how to load their trucks. Pallets to a certain height. Load up the front. Load in the center. Etc. And Dad usually complied. It’s their truck and they know how they want the weight distributed. But this truck was different. Note, the trailer was empty and was only supposed to get enough pallets to fill it maybe 20%. When Dad drove the forklift up, he thought the floor bed of the trailer looked unsafe and he told the driver he was going to spread them out along the length of the trailer. \\n\\nDriver: No you won’t! This is my trailer and I want them all stacked in the center.\\nDad: The floor doesn’t look good, putting all the weight in one spot is a bad idea.\\nDriver: Shut up and load the pallets in the center. What the hell do you know? It’s my trailer and you’re just a stupid forklift driver!\\nDad: OK!\\n\\nHe then preceded to load the pallets as requested and started stacking them in the center of the trailer. After a couple were in place, Dad started to drive the next pallet in when he felt his forklift slowly start sinking. He and the forklift sank through the floor of the trailer. The driver saw it and started screaming at my Dad that he screwed up and ruined his trailer and that my Dad was at fault.\\n\\nMy Dad was unhurt but pretty angry about the whole thing at the time.',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'Backstory:\\nIn the early 1990s I was a repo man. I got the job when I was 19 and thought it was the best thing ever. My boss was a habitual liar, confrontational about everything, and just generally a mean prick. His reasoning is it’s how you have to be in the repo business. \\n\\nOne night, I’m across the state line getting a car in AL (Baldwin County). I’m driving my boss’ repo truck because mine was in the shop. Our office was in FL. When we picked up cars, we always called the local PD or Sheriff to give them details on the car, where we got it, and our contact info. I hook up to the car and I’m headed back to FL on the interstate when the PD calls me back and wants me to stop and talk to an officer. \\n\\nI pull into a gas station and wait on the officer to arrive. Once he gets there, he tells me I have to unhook the car immediately. (This is a whole other legal situation, as once we have possession, it is ours. Law enforcement cannot intervene on the debtor’s behalf).\\n\\nI call my boss and tell him what’s going on, he tells me to not unhook for any reason whatsoever. (This scenario was literally in the rules and regs for FL). I hand the phone to the officer and let the two of them duke it out. \\n\\nThe officer says he has no choice but to arrest me for grand theft auto and orders me out of the truck. Boss says do it, his wife is on the phone with the company attorney. \\n\\nI wind up in cuffs in the back seat of the patrol car, and after searching the truck, the officer comes back to his cruiser with my boss’ revolver which was under the seat. “Ya know you have to have a permit for this, right?” He says as he runs the serial number. \\n\\nI heard it come back over the radio as stolen. Sigh. \\n\\nHe shows pity, knows it’s not my gun, realizes I’m in a terrible position I didn’t completely get myself into and decides not to charge me with grand theft, and won’t charge me with a stolen gun if I’ll put the car down. The only thing he would charge me with is “possession of a weapon without a permit.”\\n\\nI was booked, bonded out, all that jazz. Here’s where it gets fun. And fuzzy. \\n\\nI went to court. To catch you up, I quit working for the repo company and had zero income. Literally had to borrow money to pay for gas to get to court. \\n\\nI plead not guilty. Court offered up the paperwork for a public defender and I filled it out as honestly as I could. I listed all of my bills I was expected to pay, including a $400 a month (I know, I was stupid AF then) payment on a truck I had bought. \\n\\nWhen the judge read that paperwork, he threw a fit like you would see in a movie. Audible gasps from people in the courtroom. “YOU COME IN TO MY COURTROOM ASKING FOR A PUBLIC DEFENDER WHILE YOURE OUT DRIVING AROUND IN A TRUCK YOURE PAYING OVER $400 A MONTH FOR?! GET THE F#&amp;@ OUT OF MY COURTROOM!” He literally screamed as he threw my paperwork out into the floor of the court. \\n\\nI walked out and never returned. I never received anything in the mail, no phone calls, no nothing. \\n\\nI’m not stupid (anymore), so I don’t think this has gone away. \\n\\nRealistically, what should I expect, and how should I proceed to resolve this? Alabama doesn’t have records online, so I can’t even look up the current status of the one time I went to court. \\n\\nThere is a part of me that thinks it may have gone away since I have held a SECRET clearance while working as a government contractor in 2003-2005, as well as being a Sheriff’s Deputy from 2006-2010. No eyebrows were raised during either of those background checks. \\n\\nI want to travel full time and the last thing I want is a surprise in lower Alabama!\\n\\nEDIT: In regards to a comment I replied to below offering to post verification of my time with sheriff’s office, upon further thought, I’ll provide that info unedited to a mod if they want to in order to show I am being truthful.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I just found out the case is still pending and I have an active warrant issued in January of 1995.

       "  'selftext': 'So I was let go during the pandemic last year. I was already having issues with them and having an interview for a job I knew I would get. Matter of fact they made an offer seven months prior. I told my former boss and he had that long to make a counter offer. He never did. I only stuck around for so long because it is easy to transfer all over the world and I am a military spouse. I told them over and over the other company I now work for was making me a offer. When I got laid off I told them I would nit come back unless I got a equal or better offer. They never gave one, so I took the new job and kept it. \\n\\nNow my new company also has ne working in the same stores and locations as my previous company, so I do see the old boss on occasion. He is still mad I never came back, but acts like I still work for him. One day he told me he\\'d greatly appreciate if I continue to give him leads and phone numbers. I reminded him I am not working for him anymore and he has people he pays to do that. He still claimed it would really help him out. I still told him no. A week later he asked me again if I could get him leads without him paying me. I again told him no, and two days later he asked again.\\n\\nNow also like everyone I get \"nigerian princes\" who can\\'t access their money on a daily basis. Most recently a large number of them have been giving me numbers to call or text. I don\\'t unless I am bored and want to waste time wasting their time. Especially since the more time they waste on me, the less time they spend with victims who fall fir their crap. They want me to call them but I never do. They keep asking me to do so. So......\\n\\nCue double malicious compliance. I told the old boss fine okay. I will submit numbers when I get them. Little did he know he would be getting exactly what he wanted, names and phone numbers. My Nigerian princes would also get what they wanted, someone to call them. Any time a Nigerian prince gave me a name and phone number, I put it in my old boss\\' website to be signed up as a lead. I never say who is putting it in. I just do. As a result, his secretary (who I actually feel bad for) has to call these princes and the princes get a plugged up phone line and a free estimate. This has gone on for some time and the old boss\\' follow up system is now full of about hundred\\'s of nigerian prince phone numbers. The reason it is so high is they sell the numbers they call....his office number. When anyone calls it, his system saves it for follow up. He is in the process of changing his number because of at least 20 princes/fbi/irs/lottery winning calling him daily.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"TL:DR at the end\\n\\xa0\\nQuick background information: I grew up in small-town, rural America. My town had its own well-read, daily newspaper with a staff photographer who was somewhat of a local celebrity. This is important later in the story.\\n\\xa0\\nAs a lifelong Horticulturalist, my father was strongly in favor of live plants in a home’s landscaping, and loathed manufactured lawn ornaments of any variety. When I was a teenager, a very popular lawn ornament came into fashion in our area, known as “Lawn Sheep.” Basically, it was a piece of plywood, cut in the shape of a sheep, and covered with black, white, or brown faux wool – along with other accessories that made them look like sheep. They had stakes on the feet, so you could put them in the ground to stand upright. There were different sizes, too, so people created little ‘sheep families’ in their front yards. My Dad HATED the lawn sheep, and often had snide comments when he saw them.\\n\\xa0\\nMy older brother and I were in the car with Mom &amp; Dad one day, and we passed a football practice field (known to all as “the East Field”) that is in a small valley, and very viewable from two busy streets. My dad pipes up from the driver’s seat, “Wouldn’t it be funny if someone gathered up all the lawn sheep in town and put them down in the East Field, like they were grazing?” My brother and I locked eyes in the back seat, and replied, “Yes, Dad. That would be VERY funny!” Cue malicious compliance…\\n\\xa0\\nSoon thereafter, my parents went out of town for the weekend, leaving my brother and I alone. On a Friday morning, we agreed that it was time to hatch our Dad-inspired plan. I recruited another friend, and we spent the day driving around town, writing down the addresses of houses with lawn sheep in their front yard. We’d record how many sheep, the colors and sizes. We then went home and created address tags for each of the sheep – so the homeowners could get their sheep back after we rustled them. Around 11:00 that night, we began driving to each of the addresses we had written down. My brother drove the van, and my friend and I would run up, snatch the sheep, run back, and throw them in the van. While driving to the next house, we’d affix the address tags with packing tape. \\n\\xa0\\nWe had scoped out well over 100 lawn sheep earlier in the day, but by 1:30 am, we had only gathered 35. We decided that was enough; parked near the end of the field, and ran with as many sheep as we could carry at a time, and planted them in a random group in the middle of the field. We returned home, and looked up the phone number of the newspaper’s staff photographer, and called his house at 2:00 am (mind you this was in the pre-cell phone/pre-internet days, even before caller ID was a thing). When he answered the phone, I told him, “Report to the East Field with your camera at daybreak. There’s a picture waiting for you!” \\n\\xa0\\n“What do we have there?” he asked. “Sheep grazing,” I replied, and then quickly hung up.\\n\\xa0\\n[Here's a link to the photo we were rewarded with in the next day's local newspaper. ](http://imgur.com/gallery/nQKl6dS)\\n\\xa0\\nTL:DR – Dad makes a joke about stealing lawn ornaments from houses. My brother, a friend and I take it as a challenge, and craft a harmless public prank. We were rewarded with a front page photo in our local newspaper.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I work at a small garden centre and we have a system where if the queue is getting too long, the person on tills calls on the radio to open another till. Basically means that staff can be doing other things when there aren\\'t enough customers to justify having 2/3/4 tills open. I\\'m sure you can guess where this is going already.\\n\\nOver the last week or so, it\\'s been absolutely baking by UK standards and to top it off, our till area is what used to be the main greenhouse before the site got expanded. Old greenhouse, little air flow, scorching weather, it was hot as balls in there. This was causing a combination of angry customers and exausted staff and to top it off, our uniform is more what you\\'d call \"guidelines\" than an actual uniform. Navy polo, toe capped boots and you\\'re good to go. So when I get the call for a second till, there\\'s about 3 or 4 groups in the queue and I go to walk past the queue with some sweets (to keep me sweet) and my water bottle, to go to the tills. Until a 6\\' rugby player looking type at the back of the queue puts his arm to stop me. What follows went something a little like this:\\n\\nHim: \"Oi mate! Don\\'t you know what a queue is?\"\\n\\nMe: \"But I\\'m...\"\\n\\nHim: \"No buts! You don\\'t get to skip!\"\\n\\nMe: \"I\\'m just going...\"\\n\\nHim: \"I don\\'t care! You wait like the rest of us!\"\\n\\nAt this point, with this guy getting pretty angry and turning a very deep shade of crimson, I look at the till with an exasperated look, catch my colleague\\'s eye and just go \"fine then!\" and wait. It was too hot to argue over this and I wasn\\'t going to risk this getting physical. My colleague with a knowing smile picks up her radio and says \"Can I have another till please? I don\\'t think Caridor can make it\". No one arrives, probably due to a combination of radio issues, breaks colliding and \"not my problem\". So we wait. Only takes about 5 minutes to get to the front but angry dude is getting redder by the second. So he goes up to be served with a loud \"Finally!\". I\\'m now in the front of the queue, go up to my till, log in and call out \"Can I help anyone on this side?\". There was a loud \"Are you fucking with me?!\" from angry dude but my colleague was quick to loudly point out that I did try and explain several times, that he got very aggressive with me for doing so and was honestly lucky we were serving him at all. He decided to just leave rather than embarress himself any further. Left his purchases on the desk and just left. \\n\\nI\\'m glad I didn\\'t get in trouble for that one but it was a fun bit of MC.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"My friend had a job where he did the deliveries for a building company, with a big truck with a crane. One time he was assigned to deliver some heavy bricks. Once my friend arrives, this fella comes up and demands that the bricks will be deliverd at the back off his garage. My friend refuses, says to the guy that this is too far for his crane with a heavy load, he cannot guarantee that it will be done safely.\\n\\nThis fella is pretty persistent, starts complaining, threatens to calls the brick company boss, gets angry, until my friend (who was only 21 years old at that time) gives in.    \\n\\n\\nSo my friends starts the job, climbs onto his truck, picks up the package of bricks with his crane, you know, the kind of crane where a package of bricks will be pressed together from the side to lift it up. He picks up the bricks, goes over the garage, but his crane looses pressure because it's too far, so my friend tries to lift the crane a bit to reach the spot where the bricks should come. At that point, because of the low pressure, the bricks slip out of the crane, onto his garage, through the roof, on his new shiny BMW.  \\n\\n\\nGuy is super angry, and my friend calls his boss to look what to do, and tells the story to his boss. The boss also starts to get nervous, until the point where my friend tells him that he let the guy sign a document that in this case, the responsibility for things that could go wrong lay with the person demanding that the bricks will be put down out of reach of the crane. \\n\\nBoss tells my friend, ok, good job, just don't forget to give the delivery ticket to the guy!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Many years ago, 1987, I was taking an American Writing course at the local community college in northern NJ.  \\n\\nI was repeating this class because I started a new job and my class time conflicted with my hours.  \\n\\nI did pretty good before dropping the class and expected the same with the new one.  If that were the case, I would not be writing this now.\\n\\nTo put it lightly, I could not have been more wrong.  The professor, I will call Miss Marx due to her political leanings (yes she stated that she was a Marxist and everything that went with it) and she explained everything that she expected from the class.  \\n\\nDuring the break I said that I was probably going to be late frequently due to my work hours.  I worked third shift then (12 A.M. thru 8 A.M.) and class started at 8:20.  She said that would be ok.  (Important later)\\n\\nClasses go on and everything we do is basically anti-American.  Everything.  If someone was a criminal in the story, she would say \"Like Oliver North\", or \"Like Ronald Reagan.\"  Now I\\'m conservative and was getting annoyed.  I was also one of the older students. 27 at the time.\\n\\nI wanted to graduate that semester with my best friend and was biting my tongue for weeks.  Finally I had enough.  I said, Miss Marx, \"This is an American Writing course not political science.  If you want to debate politics then maybe that should be done during breaks or before or after class.\"\\n\\nThe gasps were loud and she glared at me and you could see the steam coming out of her ears.\\n\\nEvery paper I did up to then was graded an A or B.  After that everything was an F.  Didn\\'t matter if I corrected what she didn\\'t like.  \\n\\nCouple of weeks after that she said that we were going to the library to be shown how to use it.  Since I knew anything I did would piss her off I asked her why?  We are in college.  We should know how to use the library.\\n\\nA cute girl sitting in front of me asked me how old I was.  I told her 27. She said I was old. Gods above.\\n\\nDuring the break as I\\'m going to get coffee, she stops me and tells me that I might as well drop the class since I\\'m not going to pass.  She stated that my work was not failing and I had too many  absences.  I said that I have perfect attendance and that yes while I was frequently late, I did not miss a class.  She replied, \"I have you marked absent 12 times.\"\\n\\nI said that I needed this class to graduate.  She smiled and said, \"I guess you aren\\'t graduating then.\"\\n\\nI looked at her and thought  \\n\\n## “I Think That This Situation Absolutely Requires A Really Futile And Stupid Gesture Be Done On Somebody’s Part.” \\n\\nand I\\'m the one to do it.\\n\\nThe assignment that night was to write a paper on how men were becoming more women like.  So on my way home I thought about what to do, and I didn\\'t have any ideas.  So when I got home I turned on my TV and as the picture came on I realized there is a God and he has a wicked sense of humor.\\n\\nMonty Python\\'s \"The Lumberjack Song\" was on.  I knew what I had to do.\\n\\nI turned on my Apple 2E and start typing 5 pages of prime 100% grade-a crap.  If something made sense I removed it.  I wanted this to be the dumbest piece of garbage I could possible make it. And I succeeded.\\n\\nI printed it up and brought it to my parents house and had my father proof read it.  After reading it he looked at me like he did when I smoked too much.  (He probably thought I was doing that while writing it)  He said that this stuck and I should be ashamed of even considering handing this in.  \\n\\nI explained what I was doing and asked if anything in paper made sense.  He said no there wasn\\'t.  My mother said don\\'t do it, Miss Marx will get mad, to which I replied.  \"So what he said I wasn\\'t going to pass.  I might as well entertain myself.  What more could she do?\"\\n\\nSo I hand in a paper so full of crap, you could grow prize winning roses and I wait.  Next class I get the paper back and the grade was \"A\" with a statement, \"This is what I want.\"  Cool.  Let\\'s see what I can do next.  Maybe Gilligan\\'s Island.\\n\\nSo I write like a drunken cat and all my grades are now A.\\n\\nNow comes the final term paper.  We have to write 5 pages on why the U.S. dropping that atom bomb on Japan was evil.  Not only that we could only use sources that she approved.\\n\\nSo I get to work and write 5 pages, while keeping my bile inside, and am quite proud of myself.  Especially the last sentence and I hand it in.\\n\\nI get it back and again \"A.\"\\n\\nAfter the class she calls me over and says that since I improved she\\'ll pass me with a \"D.\"  I look at her and think \"F.U.\" but thank her and like the might lumberjack, I skip and jump out of the room.  I will now graduate with my friend.\\n\\nThe day after graduation, I go back with my folder.  Yes I saved everything and went to the Dean.  I showed him my Lumberjack paper and asked him what he thought.  He said that this was the worst paper he has seen all year and I should\\'ve been ashamed to hand it in.  I took the paper out that had my grade and asked him what he thought.  The look on his face was priceless.\\n\\nI showed him my other papers and then the grades.  He said, \"She\\'s lucky she has tenure.\"\\n\\nI then pulled out the term paper and said to pay attention the aforementioned last sentence. \\n\\n\"**THE PRECEDING 5 PAGES WERE UNADULTERATED GRADE CLASS A BULLSHIT.\"**\\n\\nHe said that he would\\'ve failed me for that.  I then showed him my graded copy.  \"A\"  She only read enough to see that we agreed with her and then graded it.  His response was that maybe tenure would not save her ass.\\n\\nI then showed him my first papers where I got high grades, then the failing ones, and of course the screwing around ones.  I told him that I started failing the day I confronted her.  He changed my grade from a \"D\\' to a \"B.\"  He said he couldn\\'t give me an A because he couldn\\'t verify that I wasn\\'t absent.  I was happy though.\\n\\nA year later she was gone.  Hope I had a small thing to do with it.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I work for one of North America’s largest aftermarket auto parts stores. One that begins with an “N”, and has a blue and yellow logo. At this job, for a few times a year, we have what’s called a “Bucket Sale.” This Bucket Sale acts as a marketing gimmick, and is meant to entice people to buy more than what they need. If you have 3 or more items, you can fit them into a 5-gallon company branded bucket, and the price of your entire order is reduced by twenty percent. In all honesty, it’s a pretty good deal for what it is. The only caveat is that you’re required to purchase the bucket for $2.99.\\n\\nMost customers that I mention this sale to are usually surprised, and impressed by the generosity. Especially since I don’t follow the “at least three items must fit in the bucket” rule, as I prioritize getting a customer out of the door with a smile on their face. $200 battery? How about we make that $160. $50 headlight bulbs? Nah screw that, take them home for $35, and get a free bucket out of it.\\n\\nThe reason that I say that most customers enjoy this, is because there’s a handful of customers who would either not deal with having to carry a large bucket with them, or simply don’t understand the proposition that I’m trying to offer. Fair enough, maybe they’ve had a tough day, and don’t want to be bothered with paying less for more, it’s no skin off of my back. Usually this isn’t a problem, except for today. Not for a certain customer that I’ll refer to as Karen.\\n\\nKaren walks into the store, is friendly throughout the entire exchange, and knows exactly what they want. This is always a pleasant experience, as I hate customers who dawdle around, and only accept service on their own terms. As she’s ready to make her purchase, the following exchange occurs:\\n\\nMe: “Okay, so right now we’re looking at a total of $68.98. However, if I sell you a bucket, your order drops down to $56.89.”\\n\\nKaren: “What do you mean, why is it cheaper?”\\n\\nMe: “I have a store wide sale that’s in effect if you buy a bucket.”\\n\\nKaren: “But I don’t want a bucket, I want this stuff.”\\n\\nMe: “That’s fine, you don’t have to take one with you.”\\n\\nKaren: “But why would you still charge me for a bucket, if I don’t want it?”\\n\\nMe: “It’s policy, I can’t complete this ticket under the sale price without incorporating the bucket.”\\n\\nKaren: “So why am I paying almost $70 when you just said the total was $56?”\\n\\nMe: “Because I can’t. Either way, I imagine you still want to buy this stuff.”\\n\\nKaren: “Not if you’re going to try to rip me off by selling me an unnecessary bucket. Can I speak to your manager?”\\n\\nSo, I get my manager, and tell him what’s going on before he talks with her. Manager has no patience for this kind of attitude.\\n\\nManager: “Hi there, ready to go?”\\n\\nKaren: “Yes, but I don’t want to buy a bucket.”\\n\\nManager: “Okay, that’ll be $68.98.”\\n\\nKaren has hurt herself in confusion.\\n\\nKaren: “But I want the sale price.”\\n\\nManager: “You don’t want the bucket, which means you don’t get the sale price.”\\n\\nKaren looks at the bucket pile. In frustration she puts down a $100 bill.\\n\\nManager, while dispersing her change: “It’s a good thing you didn’t want the bucket. There wouldn’t have been enough money to give you your change back.”\\n\\nA dejected Karen then leaves the premises. Oh well, we tried to help her.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'At the start of the school year we had to pick our lab groups, the teacher told us we would be with these groups all year so to choose wisely. Unfortunately I didn’t know anyone in the class and got stuck in the only group that had an opening. This group consisted of three other girls who are extremely obsessed with anime. When I say obsessed I mean they didnt talk about anything else and wore cosplay of their favorite characters or OCs to school sometimes. I don’t mind anime and watch a few myself, but this group was over the top. On top of this they were also really into some really gross anime, which from what I heard from them, was basically squid p\\\\*\\\\*n. They constantly talked about it in graphic detail, but switched out some words with fruit names so the teacher wouldn’t realize what they were talking about from small snippets of conversation. I asked them to stop talking about it around me because it made me very uncomfortable. They told me to stop being immature and to just stop listening if I didn’t want to hear it, which is really hard to do when I have to sit a couple of feet away. They also laughed at me for being too immature to understand ”the beauty of the art form”. I thought of telling the teacher but I didn’t want to be labeled a snitch.\\n\\nFor the first couple of projects they were annoying but at least helped with the labs, but soon they started refusing to help with the labs so they could work on their art projects. One of them wrote fan fiction and the other two drew anime people. I tried to get them to help but they just wined and complained pleaded that they needed to work on their “art” for their futures until I did the work myself and just told them the answers. They were all convinced that after school they would move to Japan and create anime and manga. I did a couple of labs myself just to avoid having to listen to them whine.\\n\\nI eventually got sick of this arrangement and started refusing to give them the answers. When I did this they would bug me in the halls and in other classes I had that they were also in. They just wouldn’t leave me alone unless I gave them answers. I finally decided to give them answers, just like they asked. Only, these weren’t the correct answers. This satisfied them since they didn’t bother to check their grades. For all they knew they were making As of all of the labs. I just did the labs myself which I was fine with as long as they weren’t getting to mooch off of my work, but I still had to listen to their gross conversations.\\n\\nIn the end they realized what was going on near the end of the class, but it was too late for them to do anything about it. They failed biology and had to take it again the next year. To make room for it in their schedules, they had to drop art which was devastating for them. They were furious with me, but couldn’t do anything about it.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I\\'m sure there may be some debate on if \"compliance\" was really had here but I firmly believe that I did comply with one of the provided options so I\\'m going to post this story.\\n\\nSo when I was in middle school, grade seven, I was still a pretty mouthy and defiant kid. I\\'m sure I wasn\\'t a favorite amongst teachers who liked to assume their authority was absolute in the school but that was fine with me as I really didn\\'t see the need to blindly respect the authority of teachers when they were wrong or their requests didn\\'t make logistical sense. \\n\\nAs many schools did, mine had a dress code. Like many girls my age, I\\'d had a few violations of the dress code regarding tank tops. One teacher (who didn\\'t even tech classes in my wing as she was a 6th grade teacher) in particular seemed to be eager for any potential opportunity to give me a referral and send me to the office. I was smart enough to accept when I was genuinely wrong so I didn\\'t push the issues. Then came the the attempts at referrals for absolutely inane and pedantic offenses. I was really getting sick of missing my bus home and having to take the late bus home. Especially as I didn\\'t even technically live in that district as of the beginning of the year. I was \"grandfathered\" in when they changed the boundary. My parents, especially my dad, were also getting frustrated at their work day being interrupted by a teacher on a power trip.\\n\\nSo my devious 13 year old brain formed a plan. Part inspired by my dissatisfaction at being inconvenienced and part wanting to be \"right.\" I read the school dress code verbatim. For female students the code stated that skirts must go an inch past the fingertips and tops must have a straps 1.5 inches in width or wider with no midriff or undergarments showing. Straight forward. These well meaning rules did not however take into account difference in body types. Namely, shorter students who happened to be developing early. \\n\\nSo I chose my outfit that morning, made it to school and waited until passing period to remove my zip up hoodie and walk out of my classroom where I knew that 6th grade teacher would be waiting. Her eyes nearly bugged out of her head upon seeing me and I knew it was go time. She practically jet propelled herself through the hall towards me and immediately pointed out that my skirt was too short and a halter top wasn\\'t allowed. My friends started to giggle as I had already explained my intentions to them. \\n\\n\"Actually my skirt is two inches past my fingertips. My arms are just short. My straps on my top are also 1.5 inches wide. There\\'s also nothing about halter tops. I double checked.\" I grabbed a ruler out of my book bag and offered it to her, challenging her to check.\\n\\nHer face had already started turning red at this point and I absolutely knew I was being a little shit. \\n\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter. You need to change into your P.E. clothes or we will have to call your parents to come get you.\"\\n\\nBingo. She said the magic words. See, I wasn\\'t worried at all about the potential dress code violation. My dad had ranted after the last phone call about everything he wanted to say if this woman bothered him at work again and I wanted someone to knock her down a peg or two off her power trip. \\n\\n\"Ok, let\\'s call my parents.\"\\n\\nComplete disbelief. \"No, you need to go change.\"\\n\\n\"You said you could call my parents to come get me. I\\'m not interested in changing because I\\'m not breaking any rules.\" I responded with only the smugness that a 13 year old girl can. I knew I would probably catch flack at home but this would be worth it. \\n\\nI could see her brain resetting from a blue screen at my lack of concern over having my parents called. Most students probably beg or cry for any alternative. However, she had met an immovable object and now had to decide if she wanted to attempt to assert herself as an unstoppable force. \\n\\nShe decided she was up for the challenge. \\n\\nSo she marches me down to the office and into the detention room. She tells me this is my last chance to go change before she makes the call. My response?\\n\\n\"Put it on speakerphone.\"\\n\\nShe angrily punched in the number and stared me down. I held my pokerface through the ordeal until she hit the last digit and tapped the speaker button so I could hear the ring. I broke into a cheshire grin straight out of the storybooks and watched her face fall. She didn\\'t know what, but it was enough to tip her off that she was making a terrible mistake. \\n\\n\"Hello?\" My dad\\'s voice answered, already annoyed. \\n\\n\"Hello, Mr. Toast, this is Mrs. Davids from *my former middle school*. I\\'m calling about DrawToast. She is violating dress code and she refused to change. We will need her to be picked up.\" \\n\\nNow, my parents typically left before I needed to go catch my bus so usually they didn\\'t see what I was wearing. So naturally, my dad was curious as he knows how I am but you\\'ll soon see where I get it from, \"Well what rule is she breaking?\"\\n\\n\"Her skirt is too short and she is wearing a halter top.\" She stated matter of factly. \\n\\nNow what I didn\\'t expect was what my dad said next but should have considering he works on computers all day. \"Ok hold on. I\\'m pulling up the dress code from the school website.\" \\n\\n\"What?\" Mrs Davids asked, incredulously.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got it now. Ok. So, I don\\'t see anything about halter tops. So is the skirt shorter than 2 inches past her fingertips?\"\\n\\n\"I can just tell.\" \\n\\nIf my dad could have jumped through the phone at that moment, he would have. The stream of profanity that filled the room was truly impressive. I almost felt bad for Mrs. Davids. Not quite. my dad finished the string of expletives and name calling, pronouncing he was on his way before hanging up.\\n\\nMrs. Davids flagged down the vice principal and made herself scarce. Twenty minutes later, my dad walked in, much calmer. He discussed with the VP that he was tired of being harassed by this teacher during his work ours. The VP suggested I hadn\\'t been respecting the *spirit* of the dress code and he then got an earful too. I was dismissed back to class and put my sweater back on, having accomplished my goal. \\n\\nThe next year there was indeed an embargo on halter tops in the dress code. I went the rest of middle school without a call to my parents, though.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'These MCs are also related to uniforms. \\n\\nSeveral years ago I worked at a company that had been awarded a large (if not permanent) gov contract. Being in a niche market and next to no competitor, the bosses’ focus were solely internal , i.e. micromanagement, gotcha moments etc.\\n\\nWe also had fairly high turnover for its size, 2 or 3 resignation every 6 months. And I am not surprised one bit . \\n\\nNot long after getting the job, I overheard management comparing newbies to monkeys. \\n\\nteam leader A “you get monkeys if paying bananas” \\nBoss “monkeys can do their jobs better , and I save on paying wage, insurance, benefit”\\n\\nRage rage , but new grad has no leverage, student loan still has to be paid. I keep head down, learnt to “human“ , networked, surveyed skills required in related fields and eventually began a side degree, still working full time. \\n\\nI apparently “humaned” quite well,  got a raise (of $13 per fortnight, pre-tax ) to train newbies . I remind each one coming through to always develop themselves and be ready for opportunities . \\n\\nBack to uniforms, they were smart looking shirts, so perfectly ok to wear out and about. Two were issued to us at the beginning of employment. Uniform is not required if working in sterile environment. So sometimes I commute to work in civilian cloths and go straight to sterile room. Being a trainer, I go in and out of sterile room as required so keep uniform in locker.\\n\\nThe drama. One day I walked into the office to what was the aftermath of heated exchange between boss and a newbie. Newb was crying and boss was accusing newb of being a drama queen and began listing all (unrelated) trivial mistakes Newb had made in the a few month Newb was here. Turned out Newb had found a new job and was handing in notice. It was record for the shortest employment at Company. This angered boss and Newb retorted that new job has better prospects.  Newb then proceed to quit on spot. Boss pulled out some policy and demanded uniform be stripped off and returned NOW as they were company property. It was summer and Newb clearly didn’t want to go home wearing undergarments only , so offered to wash the uniform and give cleaned ones back, to which Boss reiterated the company property policy , saying walking away in uniform is theft . Gotcha, right ? \\n\\nEnter the counter MC. I ask how many uniform was issued. Boss said two owed. I go to my locker, gave Newb my two uniform to hand in. Newb went home with dignity, technically owing Boss nothing . \\n\\nI quit months later, to a role that almost doubled salary. Company going strong last I heard.\\n\\nMoral of the story, be the change you want to see in the world . \\n\\nTL;DR staff quit, boss demand company property - uniform be returned on spot. Returned the required number of uniforms, no stripping was involved .',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Like many others before me, this is a simple one that happened a couple years ago. I worked 12 hour shifts, 7pm to 7am at a factory manufacturing hygienic products. We are supposed to have 5 paid breaks a night that last 10/20/10/20/10 minutes. I was a lead and ran a crew of 3 other people. Being a lead I took it upon myself to skip breaks if our manufacturing line was running bad or things needed to be fixed. \\n\\nWe had a hot cafeteria that served food but for night shift this was only open 7-11, so if you didn't get out to break early to buy food or didn't bring your own you were kind of SoL. The problem with the cafe was the workers were at the end of their shift and didn't care about us night shift workers. So they took their time making food. Simple salads would take around 10 minutes to put together. And being that your longest break was 20 minutes it gave you no time to eat. \\n\\nSo to the meat of it. Like I said I skipped breaks pretty frequently to keep the line running good, sometimes 3 out of my 5 breaks. I forgot my lunch at home one night and figured I was gonna grab some food on my 20 minute break. They took 12 minutes to make a salad and I wasn't gonna have it sit out or in the fridge because I wanted it fresh so I took a 30 minute break to eat my food. I ended up skipping 2 more breaks that night. \\n\\nRight before the end of the night though my supervisor pulled me from the line saying I can't be taking long breaks like that. We argued back and forth saying since I skip breaks and the cafe takes forever to make food one 30 minute break should be okay, but that the scheduled breaks aren't 30 so I shouldn't do that. \\n\\nI dropped it but told him if I didn't have time to get food and eat and I was still skipping breaks I would take 30. He said he would take corrective action. I did it one more time and he gave me a verbal warning. Cue malicious compliance. I took every break right on the dot the next couple nights. Line down and needed me to do work? Told my techs to clean and I'll fix it when I'm back. Machine calling out? If you see bad product shut it down and we'll figure it out when I get back. \\n\\nAfter about a week of this I got asked in the end of the night meeting why my numbers were dropping and things have been getting worse. I told them I started taking all my breaks on time because my super told me off for taking a couple extra minutes to eat lunch. No one liked that super anyway and they talked to management about it. While technically the policy states those break times are what we should be following, the fact I was skipping breaks and getting good numbers and it wasn't interfering with other crew member breaks it shouldn't be a problem. \\n\\nHe still works there and makes everyone's life a living hell cracking the whip and getting people in trouble for stupid stuff but last I heard he was under investigation about how he's running things. I left about 6 months after that though because of how he was trying to be more of a manager than the actual manager was and had a terrible attitude doing it and made everything so stressful.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"This is many years back, but I'm sure still applicable four some.  In highschool I had significantly less means than most of my friends (though nobody was rolling in cash).  I was  and frankly still am, too proud to ever ask for, let alone accept, any kind of handout from my friends. This made going to a diner after extracurriculars an odd affair.  Given my utter lack of funds, I would usually just get water while everybody else ordered appetizers or full meals, then I'd eat their leftovers and it usually would make no difference.  \\n\\n After a time, one place we frequented (national diner chain, food has silly names) ostensibly changed their policy, and only brought water to those who placed an order.   Simple solution, pour someone else's water into an empty coffee cup.  Problem solved.  The server didn't seem to care for this, and let me know those cups were meant for coffee, but I ignored that particular edict and kept at it.\\n\\nNow it gets fun. \\n\\nBeing a clever sort, I would mix jelly packets and/or syrup from the table into the water and walla! Juice!  After a few visits the server (who I'm sure in hindsight was working on direction from an over zealous manager) sees this and says 'you're going to have to pay for that'.\\nMe: 'For what? ’\\nS 'for the syrup'\\nM 'it's not on the menu'\\nS 'it's only on the table to put on things that are on the menu'\\nM 'what about the water, typically it isn't put on anything on the menu'\\nS 'you shouldn't have that either, it's for paying customers'\\nM 'no one sitting at any table in this entire restaurant has paid yet'\\nS 'you know what I mean'\\n--quick aside, I was and am known for being argumentative and generally effective with my disagreements.  The table was watching this like a tennis match, not like a car wreck--\\nMe 'but the syrup came out with their meals, is there a limit on how much they can use'\\nS 'they can use as much as they want, you can't use any unless you order something'\\n\\nOne friend sees my plan,  mixes up a syrup juice, and puts it in front of me.  The server  gets frustrated and leaves.  When they come back they say 'my manager says you need to order something or get out'\\nMe 'Fine, what does a jelly packets cost?'\\nS 'they're not for sale, they're complimentary for customers who have placed orders'\\nM 'so if I place an order and change my mind'\\nS 'we'll charge you for it and call the police if you don't pay.  Are you going to order something or are you leaving'\\nM 'they're my ride'\\nS 'that's your problem'\\nM 'make me leave for what exactly?  For excessive use of condiments and consumption of water?'  \\nS 'for loitering and trespassing unless you order something'\\nM 'fine, before I do, let me make sure I understand this correctly.  I place an order from the menu, then you'll bring a water in a proper cup, and how I chose to consume the complimentary things on the table  with my order is my business?'\\nS 'sure'\\nM 'I would like a side of honey mustard, an empty plate, and a water with no ice please'\\nS 'you can't put syrup in that water'\\nM 'I'll prepare my food how I like thank you.  [looks across table] can you spot me a quarter?'\\n\\nThe server wouldn't bring any more syrup out, so I went to empty tables and took it.  After the meal was done and I'd had copious jelly-juices, it was time to split the bill.  I chime in with 'don't worry, I've got the tip'.\\n\\nWe stopped going there.\\n\\nTLDR: The poor kid was told no free jelly nor water, and was forced to order something.  He then used all the condiments he could see after ordering a side sauce on someone else's tab.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I\\'m a barista at a large cafe chain, and I have learned people can be a bit particular with their coffee. That\\'s fine. And if people don\\'t like their order they are entirely within their rights to ask us to change it for them. Most people won\\'t come up at all, and the few that do are happy with their order the second time. Not today, oh no.\\n\\nIn the middle of a busy rush (as the weather here has been extremely hot), this lady comes up and asks for a skinny vanilla iced latte with extra vanilla. So default is 2 pumps, extra is 4 usually. So i pumped the vanilla 4 times into her 12 Oz cup, poured her skinny milk and then poured her 2 shots of espresso on top of this. I handed her it and moved onto the next customer. \\n\\nAbout 5 minutes has passed. She comes up with an empty cup and says that there wasn\\'t enough vanilla in her iced latte. I am pretty pissed off that she thinks she can just get us to make her another drink, and that the vanilla was just an excuse. So I kindly explain to her that we can\\'t make her another one as she has drank it already. She quotes the company \"promise\" to remake drinks that don\\'t meet the customers standards. So to avoid an argument, I make her another one, but put an ungodly 10 pumps of vanilla (stock levels be damned), the slightest bit of milk and the espresso. Its literally not even mixing there\\'s so much syrup. I have to disguise it by stirring it all up so that she can\\'t see the vanilla layer. \\n\\nI hand her drink to her, tell her to take a sip of it to taste. She takes a sip of it and tells me \"that\\'s MUCH better, how hard was it it to put extra vanilla in??\". I was boiling in rage.\\n\\nMoral of the story is that sometimes malicious compliance can end well for those on the receiving end, even if you don\\'t want it to.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I have just discovered I have a red meat intolerance whether caused by a switch in birth control or by being at the tailgate of puberty (19) no idea. Sucks ass as I love a good burger . This intolerance causes me to swell really badly, like I genuinely look 5-6 months pregnant and it can be kind of painful. \\n\\nMy Nana is old fashioned she doesn’t really think that allergies/intolerance can just “appear” and the person is either fussy or on a diet. Anyway my nana, my mum and I are all heading to my nanas friends (I’ll call her Maple) as we were nanas driver to her Maples granddaughters christening party and Maple said we were welcome to stay and celebrate  (mums a sucker for christenings and by chance my friend Sophie was there who i hadn’t see for ages so I went too) \\n\\nAs Maple is mostly having cakes and party food, Nan had cooked burgers before I arrived for us to eat, I told her I can’t eat it and she kicked up a fuss saying I was lying because I was chubbier (NO SHIT I’m trying to find what foods don’t make me a beach ball!) and I was on a diet, Mum tried to step in but Nana wasn’t having it eventually she just went “EAT THE MEAT” \\n\\nSo I did. \\n\\nDid I mention I was in jeans and a slight crop top? (it was a causal party) \\n\\nI rock up looking as you guessed a good 5 months pregnant or at least expecting, their are few glances from Nanas friends obviously as you don’t expect a pregnant teen to be a guest at a religious event. I say nothing. Clarify nothing. I hold my “bump”. I texted Sophie before and she is petting my bump.  Maples daughter is amused (I explained the situation as soon I noticed the glances and asked her if she wanted me to clear anything up and she laughed and said no, these were all Maples friends so this was a fun way to embarrass her for pressuring her to a) christen her child straight away b) have only Maples friends there) \\n\\nMaple and Nana are DYING. Nana insists I’m not pregnant and I just put on a sad expression and say nothing. Sophie and Maples daughter are trying not to die from laughter. All of Maples/Nanas friends are up in arms. It was amazing. Maybe a bit lame but I didn’t want to cause a complete fuss at a child’s event so I eventually explained the red meat intolerance and how Nana insisted I try her lovely burgers. Nana has always been a firm and fair woman so she knew she was beat and didn’t give me any shit.  Maple stopped whispering every ten seconds and the party went back to normal but hey..\\n\\nEAT THE MEAT',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'A week or so ago I had a night shift in a different city. No big deal, it\\'s normal for me. I had my route home all planned, with a train ticket that was only valid for off-peak travel (because it was literally 2/5 of the price of an \"anytime\" ticket), from my home station to the station nearest the store, for which I\\'d have to change at a major hub station. Offpeak travel starts at 9:30am.\\n\\nHowever, I was working with a regular colleague with whom I have an okay relationship, and instead of letting me catch the bus to the further away station, he dropped me about a mile and a half from the hub station.\\n\\nThere are seating areas scattered throughout the Hub Station, but few toilets. And I\\'d been working all night, and drinking copious amounts of water throughout, so a toilet was a necessity. The only ones I actually knew about were in the \"lounges\", as the areas past the ticket barriers are known at that station. So despite it only being about 8am, meaning my ticket wouldn\\'t work yet, I approached a set of barriers and explained my dilemma to the woman who was at the manual controls.\\n\\nWoman: Can\\'t let you through until 20 minutes before your train.  \\nMe: (thinking this is bullshit) It\\'s never been a problem before.  \\nWoman: Other people don\\'t do their job right. No one gets through early.  \\nMe: There are no toilets out here though.  \\nWoman: Go up those escalators, keep going straight on, the toilets should be unlocked up there by now. And don\\'t come back before offpeak, I\\'m not letting you through these barriers.\\n\\nSo I went upstairs, to toilets that are not signposted from the ground floor and so I didn\\'t even know existed. And lo and behold, the toilets are there, and they\\'re not locked. What they _are_ is completely blocked off by construction fencing covered in a mesh privacy shroud. Uh-huh, I was just sent on a wild fucking goose chase?\\n\\nNow, there _is_ a McDonalds just outside one of the entrances to the upper floor (the street level rises up to meet the upper floor) that I had been sent to. However, I was unsure if the upstairs seating of _that_ establishment, where the toilets were, was open so early in the morning, or if there was a code lock to prevent misuse (due to proximity to both pubs and a train station, as well as a high homeless population in the area). And I really, really couldn\\'t risk taking the time to find out.\\n\\nNow this Hub Station has 12 platforms, each with an A and a B end. The B ends are all linked by Red Lounge, 1A-5A go up to Blue Lounge, and Green Lounge gives access to 6A-12A. There\\'s no barrier between A and B ends on the platforms. Each Lounge has two sets of barriers. I prefer Red Lounge, especially when I\\'m too early for my train to appear on the ginormous destination board yet, but it was at Red Lounge I had been rebuffed. So I meandered up to the customer service guy standing behind a little cart under the destination board.\\n\\nMe: Hi, sorry, but I really really badly need to go, but the woman on those Red barriers won\\'t let me through and sent me upstairs to the toilets there.  \\nMan: The toilets that are completely out of service?  \\nMe: Looked like.  \\nHim: I\\'ll radio Blue, tell them to let you through there.\\n\\nI trotted off to Blue. Well, scurried with clenched legs is more like. And after using the toilet I exited the barriers until my train was almost due? Don\\'t be silly. I went down the escalator to platform level, walked along, and went up into Red Lounge. And the seats I chose? Well, I knew I\\'d be somewhere around Platform 9 to 12 (because the tracks to/from my area are on that side of the station), so I sat in the seating area at that end of Red Lounge, right where the obstructive woman could see me and do nothing but wonder which of her colleagues didn\\'t \"do their job right\".',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This happened back when I was 18 and 19, so best part of 15 years ago.\\n\\nI was working for one of the Big 4 supermarkets in the UK, doing a 5pm-10pm shift 4 nights a week. I was on the Beers, Wines, &amp; Spirits (BWS) section.\\n\\nIn the October I went to the warehouse to get some more stock to put out, and the phone rang at the BWS section of the warehouse, which was behind a locked door, because theft. I answered it and it was the store manager (SM). The conversation went a bit like this...\\n\\nSM \"Ram, why aren\\'t you on your department?\"  \\nMe \"I\\'m getting more stock to put out\"  \\nSM \"If we got fined £5,000 for you not being there, would you pay it?\"  \\nMe \"wouldn\\'t it just be cheaper to have someone else work alongside me than pay a fine?\"  \\nSM \"I don\\'t want you leaving the BWS section during your shifts unless you have someone to cover.\"  \\nMe \"so stay there all shift?\"  \\nSM \"yes\"\\n\\nBrilliant. Just brilliant. The first time in 18 months that SM stays late and has his shift overlap mine, he has a go at me for doing my job. Then I remembered that I was a lazy sod and I\\'d just do what he said.\\n\\nSo for the rest of my shift I just stayed in the BWS section. Didn\\'t get anybody to cover at all - at the start of my shift everybody else was on checkouts, and the late crew were never willing to lend a hand.\\n\\nSo it started in October, then November. Maybe a few hundred quid in lost sales every night, and a backlog of stock that would have to be sorted out the next morning. Then came the best part - December.\\n\\nAs you might know, people like a tipple around Christmas and New Year. Supermarkets also like to put offers on alcoholic drinks around that time, too. I wasn\\'t allowed to get more stock to put out so certain vodkas, gins, whiskies, wines, ales, champagnes, etc, all sold out. I knew there was plenty of this stuff in the back, but I wasn\\'t going to disobey SM, especially when I\\'d been doing such a good job until now.\\n\\nSo those few hundred pounds a night turned into thousands a night. I estimated that, in the week leading up to Christmas, I\\'d cost the store around £50,000 in 20 hours. That wasn\\'t solely from lost alcohol sales, but the number of people who just dumped their trollies (shopping carts) and left without buying anything.\\n\\nNew Year passed with the same story. And Valentine\\'s Day. And the entirety of March. Then, 2 weeks before Easter, SM stayed late to talk to me. Didn\\'t bother when we were losing loads of sales, only in the few months before his contract renewal.\\n\\nSM \"why haven\\'t you been putting stock out for the last 6 months?\"  \\nMe \"you told me not to\"  \\nSM \"why haven\\'t you had anyone else cover?\"  \\nMe \"I tried, but nights weren\\'t interested\"  \\nSM \"so why didn\\'t you just go and get any stock?\"  \\nMe \"you told me not to\"  \\nSM \"I didn\\'t mean it literally\"  \\nMe \"so why did you say it?\"\\n\\nDuring that conversation he didn\\'t explicitly tell me to change what I was doing. So I didn\\'t. Easter passed, as did his contract renewal date. At the start of June, the former deputy manager was now the store manager.\\n\\nThe (ex) deputy manager stayed late to talk to me on her 2nd week in her new position and told me to go back to doing what I was supposed to be doing. I said \"ok mum\" and went straight into the warehouse.\\n\\nAh, I forgot to mention that my mum was the deputy manager and hated SM because of how he treated the younger (16-21 y/o) members of staff., and says she let regional management know about it at the annual review.',\n",

       "  'selftext': '  \\n\\nThis happened 20 years ago, I got a job in a jeans store that was opening in the local mall. I was in college, so happy to make a few bucks.\\n\\nFirst day, we’re getting ready to open and my new boss shows up with a box on baby-Ts. Basically a stretchy crop top with the store name on it. I laughed so hard watching the girls putting them on, many of them not happy of flattered by that shirt. \\n\\nThen my boss looks at me (only guy working there) and tells me that I have to wear one too. I thought it was a joke, but the boss said nope, if I don’t wear the shirt, I’ll be fired before I even start. Thought about walking away, and then had a better idea.\\n\\nThe biggest shirt they had was a womens medium. I’m over 6”, size 19 neck, far from skinny and pretty hairy. So I put the shirt on, let my nice hairy belly stick out, and walk to the front of the store to greet the first customers. My boss ran out to stop me from scaring strangers. Instant regret 😉\\n\\nI never ended up wearing those shirts, laughed whenever the girls were made to wear it.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Another post popped up in my timeline today that brought back memories; debated just commenting as the story is similar but what the heck, figured I\\'d post it as its own thing.\\n\\nThe manager before my current one was a right tyrant; hated throughout the department by just about everyone. She\\'d fly off the handle at the slightest provocation, and it was a real whiplash for me because my previous job had a manager who was mostly absent.\\n\\nPart of his absence meant that he didn\\'t care when we showed up, or when we left, so long as we worked 8 hrs, and there was an unpaid hour lunch in there somewhere. Overtime wasn\\'t getting paid (we got lieu hours instead), but the work needed to be done, so make it happen.\\n\\nAnd I loved that, because often I\\'d come in around my start time, skip my breaks and lunch to get more done, and leave sooner at the end of the day. And I\\'ve always hated micromanagement. Give me a task, give me the resources to complete it, and listen if I think I\\'ve found a better / more efficient way to get you what you want, but need your sign off.\\n\\nCut to my current job, under the tyrant. She was actively trying to make me quit for a variety of reasons - it was a year in that I found out she had only hired me to fill the position until her preferred candidate\\'s contract ended, then she hoped to bully me out of the role so they could take it (nice).\\n\\nOne day, she decided to nitpick my arrival time, even though she\\'d previously said she didn\\'t care when I showed up or if I had to stay late, same as my old job. The work had to be done and there was no overtime, so do what I needed to and if I needed an afternoon off, I could have it.\\n\\nBut now, as she was tightening the noose.\\n\\n\\'The hours are 8-4\\'. \\n\\nShe was big on reversing her position and claiming that was the position the entire time, fuck you very kindly.\\n\\nI\\'d just about had it with her anyways, so I gave her exactly what she asked for. But there was no way I was being bullied out of this job. Came in right at 8, and made sure she saw me every morning at 7:59. Took my breaks and my half hour lunch, which I normally skipped. And left right bang on at 4pm.\\n\\nCut forward a few weeks, and she hauls me into her office because I\\'ve been falling behind. I shrugged, and told her that there weren\\'t enough hours in the day to do the job the way she wanted it.\\n\\n\"Well (another employee who has a similar position) gets their work done!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but (another employee) often comes in early, or stays late, and doesn\\'t get paid for that extra.\"\\n\\n\"So? Why don\\'t *you* stay late to get your work done?\"\\n\\n\"If you\\'ll remember, boss, you gave me crap for coming in late in the morning, and specified the hours are 8-4. You were very clear \"That is the job you were hired to do\". I used to come in early sometimes, or stay late when I got behind, and skip my lunches and breaks, but once you decided to give me a hard time about when I walk in, in the morning, I complied with your instructions. Maybe you should\\'ve thought of that before doing something that\\'d lose you all that extra work.\"\\n\\nAnd I walked out. Never got in trouble for it again, though she found other ways to harass me for nearly another year before she was unceremoniously told to retire. As far as I know, no one was sad to see her go.\\n\\nHer replacement isn\\'t much better, but she\\'s acknowledged that she knows I\\'ll stay late when I need to, so I\\'ve gone back to old habits, and haven\\'t gotten a complaint.\\n\\nYet.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I worked for a while at a fast food restaurant in a major city. One of my coworkers had the same last name as me. It\\'s a relatively common Irish name. Our families spelled it differently. \"Shane\" my coworker sold weed in addition to doing deliveries for the restaurant. Shane was a really nice, chill (duh) guy and was always the first to jump in and give someone a hand even if it wasn\\'t his job, so everyone liked him. \\n\\nI\\'m working the register one day when two police detectives come in. They literally flipped their coats open to show me their badges, which I thought was a thing that only happened in movies. \\n\\nDetective 1: Does anyone named Sean [our shared last name] work here?\\n\\nI know they have to be looking for Shane, but he\\'s a nice guy so...\\n\\nMe: My name is [last name]. \\n\\nDetective 2: We\\'re actually looking for a Sean [last name].\\n\\nMe: *smiles politely*\\n\\n*Long pause*\\n\\nDetective 2: Do you know anyone named Sean [last name]?\\n\\nMe: Yeah.

       "  'selftext': 'I have a wife who is absolutely hideous, but we manage to get along despite her numerous flaws. Her parents have successfully convinced her that I am less attractive than her, which has dramatically inflated her ego. It bothers me, and I feel like her parents are extremely unfair to the point where they are rather unbearable. Even though I try to tell my wife how I really feel about her parents, she never listens to me or takes me seriously. Back in March, she forced both me and my son to fly all the way to their house because it was her dumbass father’s birthday, and he was becoming an octogenarian. I resisted, explaining that I had to catch up on a ton of work, but that did not stop her. She told me that I had to be courteous, even if one of her parents said something offensive.\\n\\nWe got there and it was fine, although there was a feeling of unease in the air. After my wife’s mother finished getting ready, she came into the living room with the rest of us and said, “Oh, I see you left your eyebrows back at home!”. Everybody laughed, and my wife gripped my shoulder and said, “It’s just a joke.”. My son thought it was hilarious, which is ridiculous because he is blind. I cleared my throat and said, “May you outlive your children.”. Jaws dropped to the floor, and nobody said anything as I left the house and booked a hotel room nearby.\\n\\nMy wife called me several times, but I never answered. The only text I sent her was, “Eat shit.”. That pissed her off, and she even tried to FaceTime me. I ended up blocking her number. I immediately bought a business class ticket for a flight back home, since I probably wouldn’t be flying with my wife and son.\\n\\nI had a huge fight with my wife when she and my son finally got home and she said I was a massive dick for putting her in that situation by herself. She also said that it was obviously just a joke, and I should have handled the situation more appropriately, because her mother was very upset with my remark. I told her that her family was ridiculous, and they needed to be put in their place. She snapped and said I was the ugliest creature to ever roam the Earth, even threatening to divorce my “Caillou looking Magyar ass.”. I reminded her that she used to be a disgusting fatass, so she has no right to judge me for my appearance. She said that, unlike her, I never work to improve myself, calling me both lazy and narcissistic before kicking me out of our bedroom (I now sleep downstairs).\\n\\nWe started speaking again in April, but neither of us have apologized or even mentioned that incident. I will say that, if we were to ever make up in the future, she would have to be the first and only person to apologize, for she brought this upon me and I did absolutely nothing wrong (I only defended myself from her parents, and I will definitely continue to do so).',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So I was working at an Italian restaurant in central Europe. It was a bit touristy but overall tried to stay true to original Italian recipes, including ingredients. One of the things my boss was proud of was the spicy salami from Italy where he grew up as salami for the pizzas, so we only had those. Due to the fact that the Chorizo was already quite spicy, we only had the Pizza Salami with added hot peppers for our spicy loving customers and no \"regular\" Salami Pizza which would be common in other pizza places. \\n\\nEnter: Dude in his 40s, bold, polo shirt with a stand-up collar and his two young kids (around 3 and 5). \\n\"I want a Pizza Margherita (only cheese and sauce) for me and a Salami Pizza for the boys\"\\n\\nAs a thoughtful waiter I tried to warn him that our Salami Pizza is freaking hot and not suited for kids, which I did. Apparently that made him so angry that he started to yell at me as to what I was thinking to try to lecture him what his kids can or can not eat and that I should basically shut my mouth and bring them their God damn orders. \\n\\nSo I did. \\n\\nUsually I would at least tell the cook to leave the hot chili peppers when older kids want the pizza, but like hell I would do that for this prick. \\nSo I brought them their Pizza and stood at my station for 20 minutes to observe a father eating a Margherita while forcing his two crying kids to eat a Pizza that sometimes was too hot for adults. I even approached them to bring them something else which the father angrily declined.\\nThis dickhead didn\\'t even think of swapping their pizzas.\\n\\nWhile writing this I still feel sorry for the boys. Not because of the Pizza, but because of their father.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Many years ago I used to work as a web developer at a medical center where the types of people in that org were, let’s say, tenured. Many comfortable people who have been working there for 8+ years. Not the least of all was our manager who had been there for 20+ years and fancied herself a dictator.\\n\\nI was the youngest there followed by the other developer. Engineering was a team of 2 myself included. We had content creators, support people, designers, etc. But the engineering was just me and this other person, we’ll call her Lucy. \\n\\nLucy and I would show up around the same time every day between 9 and 9:30. Nbd, we thought, since we typically ate quick lunches at our desk and stayed long after 5 to actually get some focus time in and get stuff done. Our manager typically showed up early around 7:30 or 8 and would leave the office at 3:30 or 4 to “skip traffic”.\\n\\nNow, at some point, our manager was on some sort of power trip and decided it was necessary to call a full team meeting to inform us that “work starts at 9, not 9:15, not 9:30, but 9”. Me being a young smart ass decided to fight this tyranny and asked her “what time does work end?” , to which she very calmly stated 5. So I asked how come she leaves at 4. And she explained that she shows up early and therefore gets to leave early. I was on autopilot because the next thing I said was “But I thought work starts at 9 so how come you show up early?”. She explained that she’s made a special arrangements with the higher ups and therefore she is exempt from the rule.\\n\\nSo Lucy and I dropped it but we decided to show up exactly at 9 everyday, take a full hour for lunch, and leave exactly at 5. Meetings all day and work due tomorrow? Sorry but work ends at 5. Working on an issue where stopping halfway means it would take longer to pick it up tomorrow? Sorry but works ends at 5.\\n\\nAbout a month of this and our backlog is piling up, our clients are complaining, and my manager is fuming at our reduced output. She sits us down and asks us why this is happening. We calmly explain that with meetings, an hour lunch, and work starting at 9 and ending at 5, there’s just not enough time in the day to get stuff done.\\n\\nShe dropped the policy the next day and instead issued a “core hours” policy of 10-3 where everyone is expected to be in the office then.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Note: This is my first post on this sub and the textbox seems to spaz up every time I write something like this so forgive any tiny errors.\\n\\nI am a Canadian, living in the province of Ontario, I turned 31 this summer. I am vaccinated and I reluctantly wear a mask when the rules say I have to. My province has also been locked down for 15 months in an extremely stressful series of seemingly random escalating sets of lockdowns that as far as I could tell was doing me and those around me more harm than the actual virus we were all so terrified off.\\n\\nFor context, This story starts months back after I joined the LockdownSkeptics crowd. Our government has been extremely inept and disorganized in its approach to lockdowns. Among those issues were (in no particular orde): \\n\\n* Constantly changing usually sweeping rules that came out of nowhere, often enforced within 24 hours of being issued, giving businesses and individuals no time to prepare. \\n* extremely delayed border closures that could have saved thousands of lives in the early months. \\n* Extremely slow procurement of vaccines or any effective non-invasive screening measures.\\n* non stop excuses from all levels of government as to why even months later no plans seem to exist to set up proper guidelines that people can actually stick to.\\n* No federal task force coordinating efforts between the provinces, creating a free for all of conflicting rules, random lockdowns and provincial travel bans.\\n* classifying the majority of small businesses as \"non-essential\" and making it impossible to stay open, destroying many livelihoods in the process, then expecting these same people to continue listening to the same rules that ruined them.\\n* refusal to keep up with Covid research, mixed messaging, poor communication with the public in general.\\n* Refusing to admit to a massive explosion of mental health issues, especially in my age group directly caused by the deletion of normal life. \\n* Refusal to grant paid sick days, especially to the most vulnerable workers doing 15$/hr min wage jobs in cramped working conditions.\\n* Granting of new police powers that were edging very close to a police state, in Ontario, the police themselves finally said NO when Ford wanted to give the power to randomly stop and question people just going about their lives.\\n\\nWorst of all was a growing culture of vicious attacks on anybody skeptical of the motivations of certain groups and individuals who had proven themselves unreliable and untrustworthy in the past. Anybody questioning the constantly changing YoYO narrative or lockdowns that never seemed to bring any kind of relief. So, being naturally skeptical of authority anyways and of corporate/government entities  in particular I naturally started to look into these issues for myself rather than let the mainstream tell me what the facts were.\\n\\nThis instantly made me a target for an army of trolls and keyboard warriors, who seemed to take extreme pleasure in attacking anything posted by me or anybody like me on Canadian subs. \\n\\nI was called a tin hater, conspiracy theorist, covid spreader (which is hilarious as i had nobody to I go anywhere with) and other colourful nonsense. People were obviously scared at least at first and simply lashing out. I gave this a pass and expected it to start dying down as the government got their act together, but this never happened, especially in Ontario. Then suddenly once mass vaccinations started (2 months behind the rest of the world I might add), the insults got A LOT NASTIER. Plague Rat among others was common, telling me to shut the fuck up asshole, calling me anti-vaxx, etc... \\n\\nI found being accused of Anti-Vaxx especially insulting as I have Aspburgers and know how much harm was caused and is still being caused by the Anti-MRNA crowd.\\n\\nAnd then this vitriolic asshole u/PopularDevice posted the worst pile of acid I had seen yet, here is the quote from my complaint to the r/OntarioCanada Mods: \\n\\n\"please block [u/PopularDevice](https://www.reddit.com/user/PopularDevice) this person is toxic and acidic: to quote \\n\\n\"Oh fucking blow me.  If you want to go find a hugbox so you can surround yourself with opinions that are like your own then this subreddit is not for you. This is where people of opposing - often combative - viewpoints discuss their points of view. And while I don\\'t agree with what many of the people here say, I will always defend their right to say it, first and foremost.  The subreddit\\'s mission statement is clear; this is a self-moderating subreddit. If you don\\'t like what someone is saying, downvote it. If people downvote you, and upvote what you don\\'t like, then that\\'s just the way it is sweet snowflake.  The very notion that someone would come here and demand for phrases that paint them as an idiot to become \"prohibited\" or however you\\'d like to phrase it, is offensive.  I don\\'t know who this fucking plague rat is, but the fact that calling him a plague rat bothers him is really the only reason I\\'m calling him a plague rat. Are you a plague rat too? Or are you a COVID spreader?  Probably both judging from your stupid stream of consciousness you shat out here.\" \\n\\nWell, at that point I was DONE taking this abuse for simply trying to offer a more nuanced opinion backed up by a growing body of evidence that cover-ups had been involved in the Origin of Covid as a lab-grown rather than \"natural\" virus, seriously, DR Fauci what a piece of shit.\\n\\nSo I started a series of petitions to the good people of Reddit to stop this kind of toxic vitriol. TO stop the spread of acidic bile and allow proper conversations and discussions to resume.\\n\\nand seven days ago I got a pleasant surprise from u/reddit: \\n\\n\" Thanks for submitting a report to the Reddit admin team. After investigating, we’ve found that the account(s) reported violated [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy).\\n\\nIf you see any other rule violations or continue to have problems, [submit a new report](https://www.reddit.com/report) to let us know and we’ll take further action as appropriate. \\n\\nAlso, if you’d like to cut off contact from the account(s) you reported, you can block them in your [Safety and Privacy](https://www.reddit.com/settings/privacy) settings. \\n\\nThanks again for your report, and for looking out for yourself and  your fellow redditors.

On the bus he and most other kids would get bullied by two kids. These two kids were very intitaled. On the bus they would take his lunch and insult my uncle and other kids. Anyway one day he sick and tired of this behaviour, so that he woke up early and stole some of his dad's laxatives. This particular brand is very strong and they come in these satchets that are so potent and adult would be emptied with an hour, my uncle put four satchets on his sandwich with some other spread. That day like clockwise they ate his 'special' sandwiches. The rest of the day they were running in and out of the bathroom and it got so bad they were sent home.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'OK, this is gonna be a long story so bear with me. \\n\\nWhen I was a naive 24yo met a charming and very smart and way older man. We call him J for the story. His sister is D and I\\'m G.\\n\\nNow to the story.\\n\\nJ was 42, recently divorced (or so he told me) and got a kid that he would see the weekends.\\nWe meet online through a poetry website where both of us used to write. He was very aloof and stern on his comments and not very popular on the website because he used to always come off like an arrogant prick but I really liked his poems regardless of his personality and thats how it began.\\nI commented on one and he instantly pm back praising my writing and ask me if we could collaborate on a duet together.  I\\'ve already done it a thousand times with a few friends and people on the site that I respected so I said sure. \\nSo long story short we met on Hotmail messenger (this was nearly 11 years ago kids, so no WhatsApp, although we did chat on fb too. This will come relevant later.)\\n\\nLong story short,  we instantly connected.  He was funny, handsome and really sweet underneath all his bravado. And his dark sense of humour was right up my ally. \\nWe spent months pulling all nighters just talking and writing together.  \\nNot humble bragging but I was pretty popular on the site because I won a few awards so, by association he became popular too. People started to reading J\\'s poems and commented and obviously he got a huge head about it, but I digress...\\n\\nOur relationship became more serious after he confessed that he was falling for me and I was smitten.  So I went along with it. \\nWe talked about my recent breakup and he assured me  that he would never lied to me because the (of course he use that) \"witch of his ex wife\" cheat on him and he was devastated until he meet me. I was shocked for how bad her ex was but assured him that I was all in. And I meant that. \\n\\nOne important detail about our turbulent romance is that he was in Argentina (he\\'s Argentinian) and I was still living in Italy, in my hometown. \\n\\nSo, after almost 2 years of excuses for how tied up on work he was. I decided to surprise him with a visit. \\n\\nI bought my ticket and it literally was like a dream. He pick me up, we kiss, hug and he took me to his beach house (which would have been my first red flag but I was dumb, young and in love). Saying that it would be so much easier and fun for me doing touristy stuff on a beach port that staying in his suburbs house with no car.  \\nBecause I told him in such a short notice that he didn\\'t have the time nor the means to take time off (which again blatant lie because he was one of the partners of the company) but again, I bought it and off I went on my own almost for the entire week that I was there.\\n\\nHe only spent one night with me and the rest of the week just pick me up from whatever it was that I ended up wandering and we hang out for a few hours, have sex and then he just drops me off on the house.\\nI know that most of you are thinking:\"C\\'mon OP just get your head out off your arse and realise what a bunch of BS that is! \\n\\nAnd believe me, now writing this I realised how much of an idiot I was.\\n\\nBut it gets better... The day before I have to get back to Italy, he took me to dinner... With his 6yo son and his sister. \\n\\nI was super happy to meet his family and son but got caught off guard when he just introduced me as his \"friend from Italy dropping on town for tourist \". \\nHer sister was super sweet albeit a bit awkward and his son was adorable.  We ate, talked and off we went. \\n\\nHe picked me up first thing in the morning and dropped me off in the airport.   \\n\\nNow, that you got the full story, I\\'ll get to the good part.\\n\\nTwo days later and still a bit jet lagged I got a very interesting email. FROM HIS SISTER.\\n\\nHer email was short and very simple. \"Dear G, I know that you mind think I was weird and maybe a bit rude when we met but I it was only because I was tricked by J to join the dinner with his kid. He never mentioned that you guys were dating but after confronting J, he confessed and begged not to tell anyone or hiss marriage will be ruined.  \\nBut you\\'re such a sweet and young girl that doesn\\'t deserve his decieve. J IS STILL MARRIED AND NEVER LEFT THEIR HOME.\\nDon\\'t take just my word for it.\" And D sent me pictures of his REAL fb profile and surprise! The perfect little family.\\n\\nI thanked her and shut down my computer.  I was devastated.  I really thought J was the love of my life and was seriously considering moving there! \\nI spent all night crying and drinking wine until I get myself the worst migraine. \\n \\nBut, the heartbreak lasted about 12 hours. At 4am I got up, shower, make a pot of fresh coffee and started planning my revenge.\\nI was hurt yes, but also so angry that he not only deceived me, but dragged his sister and his innocent child in his lie. \\nI was at the other side of the world and I didn\\'t have the money to pay someone to kick his arse or egg his car. \\n\\nBut as my Sicilian father would said to me: \"If someone slaps you, don\\'t turn the other cheek...Cut off their fucking hand!\"\\n\\nAnd so I did.\\n\\nCue Nuclear Revenge \\n\\nI sat down on my desk and turn on the computer and log in his Hotmail. I didn\\'t have the password but I knew him well enough to answer his 3 security questions on the section \"forgot password\"... 1,2,3 bum baby... I\\'m in and Holy shitte... \\nThis arrogant piece of human crap was not only dating me. But other 2 girls.\\nI quickly logged onto his fb too because he had everything linked (the naivety), so I quickly changed all his passwords to :I\\'M A PRICK and discovered that his personal email was also connected to his work account. \\n\\nI dug through his emails for two hours (this idiot never erased anything so he had more than 5,000 emails).\\nUntil I found something very interesting,  the girls he was also seeing and their very hot email exchanges.  Dik  dik pics included. \\n\\nSo WHAT did I do? You guessed. \\n\\nI crafted I very lengthy and explicit email with pics and chat logs attached confessing to J\\'s wife (posting as him obviously) Begging for forgiveness and declaring how much of shitte person I was and as a proof of my willingness to change and transparency was sending this email to the girls too.\\n\\nBut that I did it only because I was a closeted gay and thought  that being a player would help me forget how much I really loved guys. That I was sick of pretending and hope she could move on and maybe be friends.\\n\\nBut not only to them...I fucking copied his entire list of contacts (including the CEO and partners of the company he worked, his parents and D of course).\\nThis email was perfection. All the pictures and chats (myself included) he ever exchanged with any other women. \\n\\nI copied myself on the list obviously as a countermeasure and move onto the part 2 of my plan.\\n\\nI changed ALL of his Fb and declaring that I was so relieved that people finally knew who was I. The Pride flag was his new wall picture and his profile picture was a photoshopped picture of two guys kissing. \\n\\nI created 5 different accounts on gay websites with ALL his info, included his phone number and started to chat with a bunch of guys until out of nowhere,  this guy sent me o better yet, he sent J a message. T Was his old Uni friend that had always been secretly lusting for him for years and although I felt bad for this later, I set up a date.\\n\\nPart 3 of my plan.\\n\\nI week after this massive Internet blow out and his family and friends angrily calling him all sorts of names (and getting fired because his bosses didn\\'t want the bad press). So J, trying to make amends with his family and friends make a bbq for his bday. \\n\\nBut I would have payed one year worth of salary just to see his face and his guests when in the middle of their celebration, T appeared with a bottle of champagne and a bag fulls of lube and sex toys to \"celebrate\" privately as I asked.\\n\\nApparently there was a huge fight and everyone left J, flustered and angry. Crying because \"some psycho wanted to ruin his life.\"\\n\\nI blocked him and forgot about everything until 6 months ago when he out of the blue sent me a message on Instagram asking me why I dissappear and didn\\'t support him when he was on his lowest.  \\n\\nAnd oh boy the satisfaction I felt when I only replied back: Sorry J, but I think everything you got, was Karma for all the lies and time wasted you feed me... Good luck 👍 oh and BTW...IT WAS ALWAYS ME 😉\\n\\nI then blocked him and made my account private. \\n\\nJ did tried to call a few mutual friends to try to get them to give him my number but they ignore him. They also got the infamous email. \\n\\nSo yeah... I got my revenge and I was woth every single hour.  \\n\\nI know. I\\'m effin petty 🤣',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This happened many years ago when I was in college.\\n\\nWhen I was a freshman, it was explained to me that our housing unit was in the midst of a prank war with a different housing unit. It was all in good fun though, and the big rule was everything had to be easily reversible. \\n\\nUnfortunately, that rule was broken just before Christmas that year. Our floor had a tradition of putting up lots of lights and making crazy displays. We had all pooled about a hundred bucks and spent a few days decorating the balcony and windows of each room. We even had lights spiraling down the halls that were programmed to make it look like someone was playing pong up and down the hallways.\\n\\nThen we woke up one morning and discovered someone had cut all our extension cords. It didn\\'t even occur to us that this was a \"prank\" until we found students from the other unit laughing about it. They were saying things like, \"Awww, they\\'re gonna cry because they don\\'t have their pretty Christmas lights!\"\\n\\nNeedles to say, we were pissed. So we had a floor meeting to discuss retribution. After much drinking and discussion, we again pooled some money and sent someone to buy more alcohol, some steaks, a bunch of asparagus, and a small electric humidifier. One of our guys was a pretty good cook, and we all had fun little steak and asparagus dinner (at like three in the morning). The key here was lots and lots of asparagus.\\n\\nThen we took turns urinating into the water reservoir of the humidifier, surreptitiously crept into the other unit\\'s living area, slid the humidifier under/behind their couch, plugged it in, and left. If you don\\'t already know, asparagusic acid gets broken down into sulfuric byproducts when digested and it smells *terrible*. And that was how their living area smelled for quite a while.',\n",

I'm not trying to be mean. I think I'm nice person and I've always had people point out that to me and I always try to be gentle when it comes to other people. but I would just like to avenge my friend because now she lives in trauma.

Long after a week.\\n\\nI Actually was doing some gardening and they had a party, Everytime someone got out of the car, And head to the house... They gave me a look.. In between ugly, and straight look. \\n\\nThey put some metal rebar\\'s inbetween my uncle\\'s and their house, I think he had a lampost nearby the line, Not precise about that, Mainly talking about the upcoming violation.  \\n\\n\\nSo today my father said that this guy got suckered in to buy some property outside the houses, Intending to do something in the areas. I can\\'t tell if he wanted space to farm? As there\\'s a huge farm behind the community. Not precise.  \\n\\n\\nmain point is he didn\\'t realize that he couldn\\'t do anything in the property outside the street. couldn\\'t build anything.   \\n\\n\\nNow, I can\\'t tell if he did this BEFORE or AFTER learning his mistake. he couldn\\'t do ANYTHING in the property, Was suckered into buying it, And will be hard to sell as most people who lives in those kinda communities, has a brain. But long story short, He broke a pretty huge rule in the community, Cutted down 40 trees to make a path, On both sides of the back of the community.    \\n\\n\\nBecause of the violation, Each resident (13 other residents in the community) Are qualified to sue this person 1 Thousand dollars PER TREE. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1 resident can sue the guy 40 thousand dollars. (1k each tree) But here\\'s the catch. there\\'s 12 more (other) houses in the community, Which are ALSO qualified. Meaning, If everyone sue this guy, Would sum up to 520k dollars, Plus the house he bought alone costed 460 thousand dollars. And not precise on how much the property cost that he bought, But for heck sakes, let\\'s add 100k, as it was more than a couple acres.   \\n\\n\\nBasically a million dollars, for the house, extended properties, And the hefty violation fine. I Could be wrong on how much the properties cost, But I\\'m exampling 100k..   \\n\\n\\nMy uncle then said \"you came to the wrong fucking neighborhood\"  \\n\\n\\nEven if not everyone sues this person, Will be over 100k as obviously atleast a couple of people will sue the guy. as some other people do not like this neighbor.',\n",

How dare you challenge their fascism! They cannot ... triggered ... throwing tantrum on the floor ...\\n\\nOf course, if reddit didn't side with their Volunteer SS Squad they'd have to, you know, actually pay people to monitor their site.\\n\\nThe upshot is that reddit's headquarters is in San Francisco, where some homeless person is likely shitting Hepatitis C all over reddit headquarters this very minute!\\n\\nAll in all, if you want constructive discussion on how to stop our nation/world from sinking further down the toilet, rest assured that thanks to reddit's Volunteer SS Squad and the Propaganda Parrots that the political parties have planted, you're better off on a hamster wheel :D\",\n",

I also met a few stereotypes of a victim of bullying, not playing sports, wearing glasses, a little overweight, into \"nerdy\" stuff etc, and just generally being kinda weird as a kid. I was an easy target to bully and the amount of abuse, both before and after, really mentally affected me until my 3rd or 4th year of college but the few years before highschool are what matter here.\\n\\nWhat happened: Because I was easily picked on and kinda weird in grade school, the kids started saying stuff like, \"don\\'t pull a [insert name]\" or \"are you going to [insert name] and mess this up?\" And other variations, you get the idea. \\n\\nIn 2011 or 2012 in highschool I was still friends on social media with a few people who had made my life hell in gradeschool and I saw them saying stuff like that on a post. Now one of them was a complete idiot and hadn\\'t amounted to much but the other was class president in the final year of gradeschool, was in \"leadership\" positions at his highschool and was active in student government and actually running for highschool class president. I knew this because I had a few friends at the other school that told me. Some of you can see where this is going.\\n\\nAt this point in my life the scales are tipping where I have been getting bullied less and standing up for myself more, and I decide to start my revenge. \\n\\nThe revenge: The highschool he went to was, and to my knowledge still is, quite strict regarding rules and they had a rule about online bullying and whatnot. Because this guy is a \"model student and athlete\" I take screenshots of his online comments, in addition to other questionable posts he made, along with a written explanation as to the background and why what he was saying was bullying and how he did the same in gradeschool, and sent it all to multiple people at that schools administration.\\n\\nI requested to be kept anonymous, because my name was used as the insult and couldn\\'t really anonymously explain why it was so offensive and whatnot, and made sure all of the photos had no identifiers in them.\\n\\nAbout 1 week later him, and others including the aforementioned complete idiot, make posts on social media apologizing for their behaviors and how their actions are not in line with the values of the school. From my friends at the school I learned he had to take down all of his posters, withdraw from the school\\'s student government and the current election, and make a speech in front of his classmates apologizing for his actions and saying he regrets them, in addition to athletic penalties and saturday detentions.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Post was taken down from /r/maliciouscompliance. Might be a more appropriate here so here it goes. tldr at bottom. \\n\\nSo this is something that has been building for the last 10 weeks but is just now coming to a head this week. Fair warning, this is going to be winded and long as there is a lot of malicious compliance gradually building up. \\n\\nI got a job 4 years ago at a small but successful printing company. Over these last 4 years I worked really hard with the owners to make changes and improvements to the company. I learned to do a lot of the behind the scenes stuff that must employees would not learn or even be given the chance to learn. A lot of what I do, I only know how to do. \\n\\nFast forward from the 4 years of starting to 3 months ago. The owners take everyone out to lunch and announce they are selling the company to one of the other employees so they can retire. They originally approached me with the offer but I declined because this offer came mid-COVID, I didn\\'t want to assume the risk, and was WAAAAY short of the deposit needed for a small business loan. \\n\\nAt the lunch meeting for the announcement, of course the new soon to be boss says there won\\'t be any changes, blah blah blah the typical new owner taking over BS. \\n\\nAfter the lunch meeting and a little more time passes, the new boss is now in charge and takes her first swing at me. With the previous owner I had my schedule worked out to be a little offset from everyone else in order to do some of the things I needed and to commute to work with reasonable traffic. Well this doesn\\'t fly with the new boss because \"it\\'s not fair to the other employees\" that my schedule is deferent. By the way, the difference was 30 stupid fucking minutes in the most dead part of the day where one person could easily run the whole office. \\n\\nFine. Whatever. Now I\\'m clocking in and out exactly when the new boss listed and a lot of what I used to do is now getting left undone. \\n\\nSecond swing. After some more time a new person was hired to take the new boss responsibilities from their old position. Now one of the things I do for the printing company is do a lot of the design for new customers. I\\'m really good and decently fast at it. Not a brag, just a fact of doing the specific for of design for the company for 4 years. Now the new boss wants the new hire to start doing it because sales aren\\'t what they want them to be and they think it\\'s my design style. At least that was the excuse given to me. Just to satisfy my own curiosity, I go and check the same reports for the month since I am one of free people with access to it. At the time of the excuse, same were up almost 11% from the same time period last that. The following year they were up nearly 6% despite COVID. Again. Fine. Whatever. \\n\\nNow the new person knows HOW to do the job, but the lack of experience makes them painfully slow at it. Now on top of my changed schedule and work not being done, the art requests that come in over night are now lucky to go out by 13:00 (1:00 pm). So my curiosity peaks again and tells me to check the same reports again for the time period the new hire has started. To my ABSOLUTE NOT SURPRISE, sales are pretty much dead even and bordering on hitting the red if the trend continues. \\n\\nQuick side story. Up until this point my wife had been job hunting. At about this point she got hired with a substantial salary increase. Borderline f*** you money. Your can probably tell where this is headed but let\\'s put a pin in that for a little bit longer. \\n\\nFinal straw is actually 2 things but they were close together so we\\'ll count it as one. Now with all this the new boss informs me that the vacation time I had prescheduled with the previous owner is not fair either and I have to choose certain dates to take. I then decide to take cancel one of the times I had and none it to the following week and take that off instead. After getting back from vacation, I\\'m asked about my kids daycare situation. It\\'s early June now. \\n\\nSince COVID I had been working from home after lunch to take care of my son since daycares closed for a while. Since vaccine rollouts started, every daycare within 20 miles of my place has a waiting list 3-6 months out and because of the business, is first come first serve. Even if what was a place you were at until the shutdowns. No priority system for anyone.\\n\\nWe luck out and find a place that can have us start August 23rd. I let the new boss know in June this start date. After being asked about it again at the end of July, I reiterate the start date and get meet with silence. The following day I get an email saying that is unacceptable and I either start back full time August 2nd in office or be moved to part time permanent. \\n\\nAfter some math, my wife and I come up with a solution. I respond back and say it\\'s my 2 weeks notice and the final week I will only be part time. Thanks to my wife\\'s new job, we can easily afford one income and I get to be a stay at home dad for a while. \\n\\nNow on top of everything else not getting done, the one person who knows most about the company maintenance is leaving and at an accelerated schedule as well and with nowhere near enough time to teach everything or even 20% of what I know to other employees. Since my notice, I haven\\'t even been asked about the million behind the scenes things I do like website updating and what not and I\\'m not bringing it up unless asked. \\n\\ntl;dr be boss thought they could change stuff only for me and no one else and I\\'d take it. Ended up working down productivity and losing a good worker.',\n",

But LJ is a Missouri resident which doesn’t have the best LGBTQ acceptance. Asshat evicted LJ for being trans and gave him no notice about the eviction which is illegal as well. I googled the laws and found that Asshat violated the human rights of Missouri and violated the discrimination laws. So now LJ will be filing a complaint for housing discrimination and can sue Asshat for what he did. Asshat can lose his license to lease,lose his job,possibly get fined,possibly get jail time,and get replaced.

       "  'selftext': 'This is in California. \\n\\nAlmost 8 years ago my parents moved into a rental home while I was living out of state. Only info I heard about the house prior to them moving in was “it’s an eichler built in the 60s” (famous architect) and “the previous tenants (owners niece) destroyed the house”. \\n\\nMy dad loved the house, mom not so much knowing how much work is needed. They worked out a verbal deal with the owner to use a portion of the rent towards fixing up the house. My parents did a lot of touch up work over the next few months (paint, redo garden, atrium, etc.) but never fixed anything major. \\n\\nIn month 4, my parents received a certified letter demanding they pay all rent up to that point. They explained the work done and the owner decided he would fix the house but they need to pay the full rent. My parents were fine with this as it’s his house and they had already fixed most of the minor issues. \\n\\nWe let the owner know the (flat) roof leaked, one of the two AC units was acting funny, plumbing has roots, and a bunch of other major issues. He would then spend the next few years attempting to fix these items himself. It was a great house if you didn’t know about the issues. \\n\\nA few years later I move in with my wife and my parents moved out. I was able to handle the minor tasks around the house but eventually the issues got too big. I was having to hire plumbers (or fix plumbing myself) regularly, fix new leaks every time it rained, and much more. Eventually one of our AC units broke during the winter. I knew that telling the owner about it would probably cause my rent to increase but eventually we had to. \\n\\nNot one day after fixing the AC, I received a rent increase notice. \\n\\nNow we’re at the beginning of the pandemic and our owner decides to sell the home. I end up receiving a call from a real estate agent telling me the owner is selling. I respond with “sounds great! Have him send me a 30-60 day final notice and we will look for a place. \\n\\nI never received a notice because the owner wanted me to rent up until the date of sale. I wouldn’t have worried much except the agent started playing hardball. \\n\\nWithin two days of telling me they were selling, she had gardeners rip out my plants and throw away things they believe were trash. I was pissed. I never received notice plus I’ve been a model tenant. \\n\\nI decided to play hardball back. Any day the agent scheduled walkthroughs I would make sure to have people over. Most would walk in see the crowd and leave. She rescheduled 10-20 showings for two weeks later. Guess who found a place and decided to invite everyone over to help move that day?\\n\\nThe day I moved out they also decided to have the inspector come. I made sure to let him know about all the major issues. He calculated between $200-300k in leak damage to the frame. \\n\\nIt’s been 4-5 months and he still hasn’t sold. Listed the house and already dropped the price a lot. Every offer gets to the inspection and walks.\\n\\nIf only the owner listened and spent some money fixing his place.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"On phone so don't expect a thesis.\\n\\n\\nSome back story, I invited my mom and dad to live with me about 4 years ago. For most of that time they were a God send my late wife and I were able to go out more my mom cleaned up so we could save money on a maid etc. Well about 8-9 months ago my wife died shortly after my second daughter came out as gay (my wife and I knew before) she was nervous about it bc both my late wife and I are very catholic, however it's a Catholics duty to love and forgive over hate. My parents aren't catholic they're Christan science. Still they kept it civil.\\n\\nUntil my gf and I decided I should meet her family and went 80 miles away for a weekend. When I got back my second daughter we'll call her Lily, wasn't there. My parents were surprised bc they thought we were going to be gone for a week. I said where's Lily, they said a summer camp she wanted to go to had a last minute opening. This checked out as she has always liked horses and there was a really good camp just 10 miles away.\\n\\nI thought I'd better double check her room to make sure she didn't forget anything (she takes after her old man lol). Sure enough she forgot her pads. Now idk her schedule but I figured it would be pretty embarrassing if it surprised her. So the next morning I drove out to the horse camp. Only they said Lily wasn't there. Confused and a bit peeved I drive home and ask them where they sent her. After some words that I'd keep between the three of us they cracked.\\n\\nI drove 90 In a 50 for 8 hours straight. I used to work at one of those camps in the 90s and got her out of there. It was a quiet ride back. \\n\\nI kicked my parents out not a glorious revenge sence I don't really believe in it but justice. sence they sold their house last year. They had no where to go right away my sister said she'd take them for a week while they get everything squared away. \\n\\nTo people who have been to pray the gay away camps this might be a week revenge but it's all I'm willing to do. I told my mom that I may forgive her one day but she won't accomplish it with words but actions and weather or not lily forgives them is up to her. \\n\\nFuck this was a thesis a TLDR my parents send my gay daughter to a gay camp and I kick them out.\",\n",

After some research, I found out that the husband and wife owners (who are '[considerably richer than you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Kum8OUTuk)' types, for Brits reading this, so I'll call them Stanley and Pammy hereon) had made local and \\\\*national\\\\* news for mistreating employees and losing an employment tribunal. I was pretty desperate, however, and reluctantly took the job.\\n\\nWell, it was as bad as expected and Stanley and Pammy ran the place like a pair of malevolent feudal lords. Some of the things employees endured:  \\n\\n\\n* Extending working hours without increasing pay\\n* Semi-frequent late payment or underpayment\\n* Berating us for 'lateness' if we weren't already working 15 minutes+ before we started getting paid\\n* No breaks\\n* Making us work most bank holidays and refusing holidays almost all of the time, so that most people got probably a quarter or less of their entitled 28 days\\n* Sometimes refusing statutory sick pay\\n* A couple of employees working in sweatshop conditions\\n* Daily general bullying by Stanley - shouting, insults, throwing things and more incidents than I can possibly cover in this post\\n\\nFor some reason, the six others who worked there all took this lying down and, because of where my head was at, so did I for a year and a half. In that time, I had got their website to the point where it was actually making them money (after several years and £thousands producing nothing). After some changes in my personal life, however, I started gradually recollecting myself and becoming more angry about the situation I was in. I started looking for other jobs and had set myself the deadline of leaving before my secondary anniversary of working there.\\n\\nWith three months to go before that anniversary, I booked three days off work to give myself a long weekend and go abroad for a few days with a friend. This had been personally signed off by Stanley a month prior. A week before my holiday, Stanley was in a particularly bad mood and told me that I was no longer allowed my time off because I didn't 'deserve' (his word) it. I made it perfectly clear to him that I was going. This sent him into a further rage in which he decided that if I was to have that time off, I would have to 'make it up' by working unpaid for three days. I was so stunned by the illegality and stupidity of what he had said that I said absolutely nothing; he took this, I think, as agreement, swore at me a bit, called me some names and then stomped off. I sat silent for a few minutes and then decided it would be my last day there - but I couldn't possibly leave without attempting some revenge.\\n\\nThe first thing I did was permanently delete local and remote backups of every graphic I had created and piece of copy I had written. This stuff was quite valuable because it was almost all original and was essential to selling their quite expensive crap online, and to recover any of it would involve manually saving/copying it all, bit-by-bit, from the website. I then went into the backend of the website and changed the settings so that each order had to be manually approved. This meant that orders would come in but go absolutely nowhere, since I was the only person there who was actually computer literate. After, I changed the names of product ranges back to those given by manufacturers, meaning potential customers could easily find the same items sold cheaper elsewhere. Knowing the sort of people who shopped there, I knew this would lead to complaints of having been ripped off and people trying to talk prices down.\\n\\nNext, I phoned the web designers who I was on quite friendly terms with and who disliked my bosses as much as I did. Some days prior, Pammy had \\\\*\\\\*jokingly\\\\*\\\\* said they weren't going to pay the designers' next invoice because she felt they had been slacking. I told them of Pammy's 'plan' and they let me in on a secret: they were going to drop them as clients once their existing contract expired, which happened to be in two weeks' time. Unfortunately, the web designers also controlled the domain. They followed through and the website and email addresses were down for about two weeks. \\n\\nWhilst on the phone to do the web designers, I noticed the sheet for orders for materials from manufacturers was nearby. These orders were handwritten: nothing but the item code and quantity. Almost all of these were made-to-order, meaning they couldn't be cancelled once processed, returned nor refunded. Handily, in Pammy's handwriting 4s and 9s looked quite similar (but still distinguishable). I grabbed a pen and quickly turned all the 9s in the item codes to 4s. When the orders were made later that day, it would result in £hundreds of unwanted materials.\\n\\nAt that, I picked up my stuff (including half a bag of ground coffee) and went to leave. Then I remembered Pammy hates the smell of coffee. It makes her feel sick, in fact, so I went over to her workspace and hid the bag of coffee behind a small panel in her desk. I then walked out, never to return. But wait - there's an epilogue.\\n\\nThree months had passed and I had entirely pushed the little lives of Stanley and Pammy out of my mind. In a better place mentally, I had made some decisions and was due to start teacher training in two months' time so I was getting a little bit of work experience in beforehand at a local secondary school. It just so happened that I was attached to a class which included Stanley and Pammy's 14-year-old son. Unfortunate but it was all behind me and I'm well above taking anything out on a kid. On my last day there, however, whilst working with him and his group of friends, he said with a smile on his face, 'Mum and dad say you can pick up your P45.' I smiled in return and continued with the work at hand.\\n\\nI went home that evening intent on committing one last act of revenge. Well, Stanley and Pammy had a couple of pedigree dogs. They bought them a year prior and were very excited to breed from them and sell the puppies. They soon discovered. however, that both dogs were infertile (hilarious). This became a particularly sore topic for them and wasn't talked about much. I made a GumTree listing advertising a litter of puppies at a very cheap price with Stanley and Pammy's business landline number attached. It took a good few weeks for the listing to be removed, at which point I made another. They eventually changed their landline number.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '\\nTLDR: New landlord raises rent so we don’t renew our lease. He becomes obsessed with proving he is smarter than us and loses everything.\\n\\nThis took place in Australia. \\n \\nAbout 15 years ago I ran a small successful beauty salon as a young 20-something woman.\\n \\nWe rented a large space in a building from a very elderly gentleman who let us do anything we wanted to the place as long as we paid our rent on time. We put lots of money into improvements inside, built new rooms and redecorated and he was thrilled with the new look.\\n \\nHe eventually sold the building to a cocky late 30s smarmy “businessman” as he called himself who immediately raised the rent. No problem, business is business but right from the start he had an attitude with an all female run business and would constantly belittle us and make comments about how we didn’t know business like he did. His favourite insult was to call us bimbos. We didn’t really give two shits what he had to say in all honesty, we made our money off being attractive “bimbos” as he liked to say and he was a gross old dude with a mono-brow so we didn’t pay him any mind.\\n \\nA few months after the purchase a massive construction project took place right near our building restricting access and limiting the number of clients we could take due to no parking.\\n \\nThe construction also pretty much eliminated any walk-in clients as who would want to go to a salon when there’s jackhammering going on right across the road.\\n \\nThe new owner gave us 14 days notice of raising the rent yet again. We knew this wasn’t legal so we pushed back and got a tirade of abuse that he was a “businessman” and we were just “bimbos” who didn’t know the law. \\n \\nAt this time our lease was coming up for renewal in less than 3 months. We asked for a 1 year renewal of our lease which he refused. I guess he thought he could bluff us? He said we could sign for 3 years at a MUCH higher rent or F*&amp;$ Off. So we chose the latter.\\n \\nWith plenty of notice we advised in writing that we didn’t intend to renew our lease and he hurled abuse at us yet again saying he would have it rented in no time and we would regret it.\\n \\nWe moved 5 minutes drive away to a better location for close to half the rent and the place is actually still thriving today although I have since sold my share and moved on to other things. \\n \\nDuring the last month of our lease the landlord would bring prospective tenants in to the property day and night. He would even open the doors while people were in treatments to let the prospective tenants look around. Fortunately (?) due to the construction next door we didn’t have too many clients but the noise drove every possible tenant away without us even having to say a word. \\n \\nThe landlord had advertised the property including many of the additions we had made. However we had it in writing from the original landlord that they were to be removed and the shop returned to its original state (4 bare walls) at the end of our lease. So that’s what we did. We began to strip the place of the rooms we had built and move our stuff to our new salon. We took hundreds of photos for evidence and began the set up of our business out of our new location. \\n \\nWell, to say the landlord was furious would be an understatement. He got a lawyer to write us a letter demanding compensation for the destruction of his property. We just referenced our contract which specified a building of X size with 4 walls. We were still bound by our original lease that we had signed with the lovely old landlord. No new lease had been entered into with Mr Businessman. I offered for him to pay us for just half the costs of materials (no labour or contractor costs we had incurred) and we would leave the additions standing. He laughed in my face and told me he wouldn’t pay a dollar and that he would sue me for every dollar I made so hard that my grandchildren would still be paying my debt. He was a charming bloke.\\n\\nWe showed him our agreement with the original landlord that all changes needed to be removed and that this agreement would stand unless another was made and agreed to by tenant and landlord at a later date.\\n \\nWe stripped that place bare. Didn’t even leave a single shelf on the walls. Cleaned it till it sparkled.\\n \\nHe then got his lawyer to write another letter saying we didn’t give enough notice and were required to pay another 3 years of rent. I said show us the contract where we agreed to this? We were then sent a copy of our email requesting a 1 year contract and an invoice for the rent for that period. Well I said he never agreed to that and we never signed a contract for that either.\\n \\nIt went back and forth getting nastier and more ridiculous. He was obsessed. I decided it was time to get some revenge and hit him where it hurts- his pocket.\\n \\nEvery communication I got from his solicitor I made sure was sent to me registered post. I would often respond to only part of a letter, requiring the solicitor to send another letter to follow up. I was a bimbo after all, right? I couldn’t be expected to answer more than one question at a time!? I would respond to each letter by email but require a registered letter acknowledging receipt of my email. Solicitor was more than happy to oblige- more billable charges to his client! The more petty the landlord got the more petty I became in response. Don’t even try to out-bimbo a bimbo, mate.\\n \\nThe landlord had at this time also refused to refund our bond claiming he hadn’t had time to do a final inspection. So we lodged a claim with the appropriate ombudsman and of course the landlord came back with a laundry list of fake damage claims, luckily we had our photos to prove he was full of shite and he had to return our bond in full. By this stage we had been out of the premises for 7 months and were doing great at our new location. \\n \\nIn that whole time he couldn’t get anyone to rent the place due to the construction even after reducing the rent 3 times.\\n \\nHe had spent so much money on solicitor fees and failing to collect rent that he had to sell the building and his wife filed for divorce. We found this out when the daughter of the lovely original owner called us to tell us the sad news that he had passed away. He had always loved us girls and we would always spoil him if he came to visit and fuss over him with coffee and biscuits and give him his favourite treatment of a hand massage. The daughter was friends with Mr Businessmans wife and gave us all the goss.\\n \\nIt took the new nasty owner another 18 months to sell the building and all the while it sat empty and he didn’t collect a penny in rent. \\n \\nGuess he shouldn’t have played chicken with the Bimbos after all.\\nWe were actually pretty happy there and probably would have stayed if he hadn’t decided to prove that we were so inferior.\\n \\nIf you ever read this- Suck it Costa, Love the Bimbos.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'May be a bit long. ProRevenge sounded like the best fit, but I can remove it if the consensus is to the contrary.\\n\\nThis happened a few years ago, backstory first. \\n\\nMy girlfriend at the time, who I ended up marrying, worked for a fairly well-known salon chain, let’s call them NiftyClips. \\n\\nAfter a month or so of dating, I was fairly disturbed at some of the stories I heard about some of the issues she had to deal with, and how the employees were treated by the management in general. She is a very talented stylist and has a true passion for what she does. Most of my working career has had some level of design involved, so I feel fairly confident that I can recognize good work when I see it. She’s good. \\n\\nUnfortunately, she would occasionally leave work in tears due to either horrible treatment from her customers, her managers, or both. I eventually started floating the idea of her exploring opportunities at a locally-owned, full-service salon. She initially was not thrilled about the idea, insisting that she liked it where she was, so I didn’t push the issue too much (although subtle hints would occasionally be dropped because I KNEW this place was holding her back, and no one should be crying after their shift on a regular basis).\\n\\nFast forward a year or so, and the opportunity presented itself. We ended up attending a festival out of town with some mutual friends, one of which owned a local salon. They got to talking and she ended up getting offered a chair, she seemed a little nervous but now there was some new enthusiasm. \\n\\nThis is where the actual story begins.\\n\\nAfter one of her mangers found out that she was going to be leaving, she was offered an 11 cent raise, and then told that she will never make more money at another salon, and that she will have no steady clients since NiftyClips provides them all for her. \\n\\nPart of her leaving included not informing any of her regulars that she was leaving and/or where she was going, or document any of the color mix instructions that she used for said clients. Also, if any of her clients asked where she is working after leaving NiftyClips, all employees were instructed to claim ignorance. The first two items are understandable, third seems a tad petty, but what came next was completely unacceptable and NOT going to fly.\\n\\nA month or so goes by, she’s loving it. Learning new skills, earning WAY better income from the start, loves going into work every day and it’s glorious to see. One day, she receives a letter from a lawyer, a lawyer representing the franchise owner. He is claiming that she stole color-cards on her way out. These are basically color-mixing information guides that are specific for each client. Specifically, 10 cards. The letter also stated that if these cards were not returned, legal action would follow. \\n\\nAfter receiving said letter, she called the franchise owner for some clarification and he basically let loose with a temper-tantrum-level, barely comprehendible, abusive rant which just caused her to spiral even further and was shockingly unprofessional. Even playing the devils advocate, regardless of what your employees tell you, as the owner of a franchise, you don’t call a former employee who is now faced with litigation and scream at them over the phone. \\n\\nLink to said letters below, sensitive content redacted.\\n\\n[Letter from shady lawyer 1 of 2](https://i.imgur.com/imIj9Wn.jpg)\\n\\n[Letter from shady lawyer 2 of 2](https://i.imgur.com/jWoFgdF.jpg)\\n\\nI’ve never met the guy, but everything I’ve heard about him seems to suggest that he’s just a disconnected, generally uncaring franchise owner that is enjoying his personal salon piggy bank, and he was pissed that one of his best stylists finally realized her worth. Literally just straight-forward, vindictive harassment.\\n\\nI would be remiss if I did not, here and now, state how much I KNOW that this was complete bullshit. Granted, I was definitely completely smitten with this goddess vixen, but that’s so ridiculously not her modus operandi. She is honest to a fault, works her ass off, and that type of thing just isn’t her gig. \\n\\nTo say she was freaked out would be a huge understatement. I had never seen her that upset. It was a solid two days of freakout-mode. We aren’t rich by any means, but we do okay. I knew immediately that there was going to be lawyer involved, on our side for sure. I’ve never had to hire a lawyer for anything and I know they aren’t cheap, but fuck that. \\n\\nTemper seems to run in my family, which my amazing wife had taken in stride and has been a HUGE part of helping me move past, but my blood was boiling. Fully prepared to plop down a good chunk of change to say “fuck no” in the most legal way possible, I happened to remember that a former coworker of mine was studying for the bar when we worked together a few years prior.\\n\\nI don’t remember what branch of law he was focused in, but I was just looking for some advice at this point, and this is one of the nicest, straightshooting, will water your plants for you when you’re out of town guy I’ve ever met, and I trusted him. Shot him a quick email just explaining the situation, asked if it was even in his wheelhouse, and seeing if he would be interested in taking the case if so. \\n\\nHe had me send him the letter that she received so he could have a look. His response was above and beyond. Link below.\\n\\nLink to response below, sensitive content redacted.\\n\\n[Letter from competent lawyer](https://i.imgur.com/a0NnKaO.jpg)\\nWe have yet to receive an additional response.\\n\\nOne of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me, and my wife. I don’t even know what could have gone down if that ended up going to court, maybe nothing, it was pretty frivolous, but that response put her mind at ease and I will be forever grateful. She is currently working and thriving at one of the top salons in the area, her clients love her to death, and I’m extremely proud of her.\\n\\nOh, and if that franchise owner ever reads this, I would love to hear details of that last conversation between you and your lawyer regarding this. I mean really, who does that to someone? \\n\\nAnd to the lawyer, sending out a letter threatening legal action for which your client has no evidence for? What was the end goal there guy? You are several levels lower on the detrimental-to-humanity-in-general scale than the pond scum you represent. \\n\\nI hope the both of you are slightly inconvenienced several times per day until it is your time to return to Hades.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"For 18 months I'd been working from home (as most of us had). From a work perspective this has been great; I've been more productive than when I'm in the office, been able to work more flexible hours and have saved a ton of money by not commuting.\\n\\nMy workplace had an agreement that those working from home can do what hours they want, so long as we are able to answer urgent calls in core hours and we get all our work done. Fair enough as far as I'm concerned. For 16 months this worked great, as above. Then over a few weekends I had a clear out of the house and tok pictures of all the items that are in good condition but we no longer want, with a view to giving it away to whoever wants it.\\n\\nOne day when I'm working from home I take my lunch break, make a quick sandwich and post the items that I'm giving away on one of those local Facebook free pages.\\n\\nI didn't know it at the time but one of the managers - called Shambles henceforth - from my work was also signed up to that page and he saw my post. He then took it upon himself to go to the owner of the company and tell him that I was slacking off and posting on Facebook during work hours.\\n\\nFor context, this wasn't my boss (who was super-chill so long as everything was done on time), nor was the complaint to my boss, but to the OWNER of the company. We're a big business so there's a lot of people in the chain of command between me and the owner. And to top it off I'd been doing a lot of work for Shambles, he'd outsourced the running of entire projects to me over the last 18 months (all of which I'd executed well and he'd taken ample credit for) and this was the only time in 18 months I'd posted ANYTHING on Facebook (because I never post).\\n\\nSo the owner contacted me, and to be fair he's a decent guy, the conversation went like this\\n\\nOwner - 'I've been told you're posting on Facebook during work hours. Just be smart about it, it doesn't look good when colleagues see it.'\\nMe - 'Completely understand, just so you know I posted that during my lunch break.'\\nOwner - 'I was told you were posting at noon.'\\n(the company lunchbreak is usually 1-2)\\nMe - 'I did but that's because when I'm homeworking I always take my lunch 12-1.'\\nOwner - 'Okay, I don't have an issue with that, just keep your head down.'\\n\\nLike I said, a decent guy. I wasn't really in trouble and the owner didn't seem to care, but then I started to think 'wait, who the hell has gone to the owner with this in the first place?!'\\n\\nLong story short, a coworker (who was working on site that day) heard on the grapevine that Shambles had been bitching to the owner about me and how I'm always on social media when I should be working. (I literally only have Facebook and I only use that for messenger 99% of the time).\\n\\nCue petty revenge.\\n\\nAs I said before, Shambles likes to outsource work to me, I never minded this, the work was varied and it broke the week up, plus my own boss didn't mind as I always had my work for him done on time. However, I never got recognition for this extra work. For 2 years I managed a sub-department completely on my own because he 'didn't have time to do it'. I didn't get a penny more for it, but it was a good group of people and I enjoyed getting experience of management. Well, after this everytime Shambles came to me with an issue I would say I was super swamped but that I'd try to deal with it if I had time. The projects he tried to outsource to me I immediately rejected, saying that I had a full plate from my actual job. And that sub-department I ran... We'll get to that.\\nOver the next couple of months Shambles starts missing his deadlines, issues come up with existing projects that he hasn't fixed and employees are complaining that everytime they go to him with an issue it doesn't get resolved.\\nIt dawns on me at this point that I've basically been doing this guys job for him for years. F**k that.\\n\\nI set up a meeting with my boss and put forward my arguments for why I should be promoted (or really, why I should've been ages ago). I point to all the projects I've successfully run as well as the sub-department I've managed for 2 years. He completely agrees and says he'll take it to his boss. Now somehow, I don't know how, but when I go to the next meeting with my boss's boss, Shambles is there too. He's on the same level in the company as my boss's boss.\\nA little phased, but not willing to give up, I put my arguments forward to them. Shambles let's me finish then proceeds to tell me that I don't know enough about our work to manage, I don't have the required people skills and then he tells me, and this is verbatim... 'besides, people here don't respect you. They respect me. I know I'm a good manager. If you really think about it, you know you wouldn't be.'\\nI forget what else was said after that, but I was completely destroyed.\\nBoss's boss comes up to me afterwards and tells me that Shambkes is a D**k, but unfortunately he's got the approval of the higher-ups so what he says has too much sway for him to go against him. I tell boss's boss that if that's the way it is, I'm going to look for other employment. He sighs and says 'I don't blame you.'\\n\\nCue Pro revenge.\\n\\nDuring the time it took me to look for and apply to other jobs I have time to think about how I can get back at Shambles. He's used me for years and is now blocking my promotion.\\nI'd already stopped working on his stuff and his projects were going from bad to worse, but I needed something more.\\n\\nNow this next part could be an entire post on its own, so I've bulleted it for brevity, if you want more context I can write it out later.\\n\\n1. I'm an accredited internal auditor for our quality systems. \\n2. I ask if I can be assigned a couple of last audits before I leave 'to help them out'.\\n3. I carry out these audits, and using my intimate knowledge of Shambles' projects find every single issue I can.\\n4. A number of people also hate Shambles and give me more dirt on him.\\n5. Someone gives me breakthrough information that Shambles has been forging signatures and bypassing multiple company procedures to make his KPIs look better.\\n6. I write up the report, with tons of evidence attached and send it off.\\n7. The report gets flagged at the highest level because of what it shows.\\n8. Shambles gets dragged over the coals.\\n\\nI wish I could say this story ends with the Shambles getting fired and having to sell his body on the street for scraps, but (obviously using all the connections he has) he keeps his job. I later found out though that he was due a massive promotion (as in, catapulted to the top of the company, running whole divisions kind of thing). That never happened though, with his declining numbers as well as a damning audit showing all his shortcomings he's basically told he'll never progress beyond where he is and that he's lucky to have a job at all. He still works there and I'm told his ego has been taken down a whole washing-line worth of pegs. \\n\\nAs for me, I'd love to say I got a better job with a massive raise. That's half true. I decided to pursue my dream job (literally, since I've been a kid dream job) in a totally different industry. All the experience I had counted in my favour and although I took a bit of a paycut I've never enjoyed work more.\\n\\nOh, and that sub-department I was running. They knew that when I left Shambles would take over running them again, so in my last month at the company I gave them all tutorials on how to search for jobs and pass interviews (I'd worked in recruitment previously). I've heard from a number of them since that they'd landed better jobs and thanked me in part for it.\\n\\nNot the perfect ending, but I'm damned happy with it.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hey guys. It's been a while since the last i have posted on Reddit, but I needed to share this story. \\n\\nBack in March, I got involved in a road raged moment that scared me shitless. I was driving around with my wife in the passenger seat. All was good and we were getting close to home when a taxi driver, in an empty street, cut me off. Maybe he didn't see me, maybe he didn't pay attention, whatever. \\n\\nI honked at him to avoid a collision and he swerved away. But when we stopped at a light, for some reason, he wanted to argue with me, claiming it was my fault. \\n\\nI was not in the mood for such thing and ignored. That set him off in a rage I haven't seen before. He, then, drove forward, blocked my car, got out of his car and walked to my wife side. I decided to take video evidence of this in phone just for precaution. \\n\\nHe started cussing my off, threatening me and said that I was luck HIS SON WAS IN HIS CAR. Who road rages and tries to pick a fight with a fucking child in the front seat? What kind of example are you?\\n\\nAnyway... I decided to back up, go forward to avoid him and film his licence plate, as well as the company he worked for. Because of that he drove into me, hitting my side mirror in the process. \\n\\nI got out of my car and told him I was gonna call the police. Because I was in front of his car, he tried to run me over. I jumped away from it and, out of reflex, punch his side mirror. It blew into a million pieces and off he went. \\n\\nI was so furious I couldn't even think right. My wife got out of the car to talk to me and calm me down. \\n\\nRevenge: \\n\\nWhen I was able to think calmly, I went to the police station with the video evidence and the contacts for the witnesses (my wife gathered them for me).\\nI filled a police report. Later on, I called his company, request his details and emailed them the video of everything that happened. They said they would look into it. \\n\\nWith his details, I was able to find his social media and, lo and behold, I found his wife social media as well. I contacted her and sent her the video, told her about the threats and how he did everything in front of their child. \\nShe thanked me and I thought that was that. \\n\\nFast forward to last week and I had to testify in court about the whole ordeal and then I found out what happened. \\n\\nNot only he was fired from his job, he got arrested for assault with a deadly weapon and endangering a minor  got his license revoked, got divorced, had to pay court fees, a bunch of fines and had to pay for the side mirror (was the company's car). \\n\\nI didn't get any money, but my car will be repainted next week in his dime. \\n\\nSucks to be you, huh?\\n\\nIf anyone is interested, I've got the video to share. Including the cussing, the threatening and the collision. I don't have video evidence of him trying to run me over, though.\",\n",

Fast forward 6 months later and I look on my list of banned people on discord and low and behold it was the hacker so I friend them and they accept it and dm me saying “hello” so I reply and I ask them why they hacked me and they say IDK and we talked for a bit and somehow it got on the topic of GFs and they say I’m having some issues with my GF and he explains how she is around other guys a lot and how she is touching them so I think and make up in my mind to scare them so I say you suspect she is cheating? And he says yes and I proceed to tell them what to do if he broke things off with her and she stalks them. I tell them that they will have to make a new social media account and go inactive on the other and to change the name of their internet and etc and by the end I can tell their worried and say I may not be there to help them and say bye before leaving discord…..revenge is a good feeling.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Yes, I know there are a lot of mailbox stories on here but I just learned this story from my Dad involving my Uncle Dale (family friend who passed away a few months ago) and figured you guys would get a kick out of it.\\n\\nYears ago, back when Uncle Dale and Dad were university students, their engineering professor came to their class with a problem that needed solving. His mailbox was getting broken by someone driving by every night. He and his wife had put up something like four or five mailboxes and all four or five times, the mailbox had been knocked over by someone driving a red truck.\\n\\nThis professor offered extra credit to any group of students who could come up with a truck proof mailbox that not only fit with city regulations but within a budget of $20 (which back then was a good size chunk of change).\\n\\nWell, if anyone here knows anything about engineers (as Dad puts it), they love solving problems. And if it\\'s engineering students, they\\'ll make it an experience to remember.\\n\\nDad and Uncle Dale got together and got to work. They found a steel bar that fit within mailbox regulations (posts have to be a specific height, width and depth) and filled the inside with a mixture of concrete and steel rebars. Once the concrete had cured, they welded 8 rebars to the sides of the bar, bent them in half and stuck it inside a bucket. To add extra weight, they filled the bucket with the heaviest rocks they could find. \\n\\nAs a finishing touch, they painted it brown and black (to look like wood) and put \"the ugliest mailbox we could find on sale\" on top, welding it down for good measure.\\n\\nThey brought this monstrosity into class (more dragged it because it was so heavy) and told the professor to bury the bucket where the mailbox stood. Since they were the first to turn in their project, the professor agreed to give it a try.\\n\\nThat night...the professor and his wife were awoken by a metallic BANG!!!!! followed by a lot of cursing. They went outside and wouldn\\'t you know it, there was that red truck speeding away, the mailbox still standing. At the base was a broken wooden baseball bat. \\n\\nTwo days later, the professor gets a bill in the mail for a hospital visit. Turns out when the passenger hit the mailbox, he did some serious damage to his arm and shoulder. They were planning on suing the professor but the professor hired a lawyer who basically told the plaintiffs \"You\\'re just going to admit that you were vandalizing the mailbox multiple times?\" That shut them up.\\n\\nTo the best of my Dad\\'s knowledge, the mailbox is still standing. The other students who still brought in mailboxes had theirs gifted to different professors throughout the town and are also still standing.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"So I was told this story might fit here. TLDR at the bottom. Sorry for poor formatting or grammar. I went to school in California in the 90s. \\n\\nI bought a house 4 years ago in a quiet neighborhood. I had wanted to get into that neighborhood for years. My best fried lives there. It was a couple blocks from my kids school. It was a good neighborhood. Then covid hit. \\n\\nMy neighbors across the street were forced to move at the beginning of the pandemic before the eviction moratorium was in place. They were really good neighbors. We were friendly with each other and we were sad to see them go.  So when the property owner rented to a new family we were hoping we could cultivate a friendly relationship.  Unfortunately that was not the case. \\n\\nAbout a month after they moved in the lock down started. And that's when things went from 0-100 real quick. For the next year every night there was a huge party. Cars down the street music so loud you could hear it over regular house noise in every room in my house. My friend in the next cul-de-sac would text me regularly if the music he was hearing was my neighbors. \\n\\nWe tried to be civil. I asked politely. I brought them beer I offered some killer 420. Eventually they threatened me an my wife so we started calling the police. Almost every night for 4 months. We organized with the neighbors. And they started calling the police as well. \\n\\nEventually the others gave up and started selling their houses because the renters were just that bad. We were still upside down on our place so it wasn't an option for us. Eventually the police told me that I needed to stop calling and that it wasn't their issue to deal with. That I was a bigger nuisance than the renters music. \\n\\nIt was at that time the housing market was taking off. Houses were selling in my area for 40-50k over appraisal value. My wife and I looked at what we needed to make so we could move and listed our home for that.  \\n\\nIn three days we had a handful of obscene offers to choose one. But it was the lowest offer that stood out to us the most. Their offere was a good 20k under the next lowest but They sent a letter. I'm a sucker for a letter especially one with a picture of a young pregnant couple and a dog... and a patrol car? \\n\\nTurns out the young man is a police officer newly appointed at the local PD. And he takes his patrol car home.  I knew at that point that this was the family to sell my house to, money be damned.  I moved out as the neighbors were throwing a huge party. The next day the police moved in and they haven't had another since. \\n\\nI drive by regularly on my way to my buddies place. They just sit quietly in their garage looking bored. I make sure I honk and wave every time. \\n\\n andTLDR: after a year of listening to my neighbors partying all hours of the night and pointing their speakers at my house and no help from the local law enforcement I sold my house to a cop.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This is one of the tales when I worked at the Mart of Walls. \\n\\nBy this point, I had been transferred to the garden center, and was actually working indoors, since we were in “Christmas Mode”, which meant we had ALL the Christmas decorations there. I swear, I was cleaning glitter from myself for months to come. \\n\\nA little background; I had taken 3 years of Spanish in High School. I may not remember much, but I also had a friend that was actually Mexican, so he was teaching me some stuff “not on the textbooks”, (which will come into play in this). \\n\\nI’m working inside, on the cash register, and the way our section was laid out, I was facing the door, with the scanner in front of me, moving things left to right. Since I was left handed, this actually flowed well for me. On my left forearm, is a HUGE rainbow star, that I had just gotten retouched about a week prior to this, so the colors were still vibrant. \\n\\nI had these older Latina ladies come through my line, with 2 carts between them. No big deal, since mostly EVERYONE ignores the “15 items or fewer” policy we have in the GC, and are also informed that, since we don’t have a conveyor belt, nor do we have a bag carousel, check out times could be lengthened because of this. \\n\\nI’m scanning and passing things off to my coworker, 9 inches taller than I am(I’m 6’ even), and he speaks a little Spanish as well. One of the ladies place something just a little out of reach for me, so I go to grab it, tattoo on full display as I did so. They caught a glimpse of it, and a look of shock washed over both of their faces. \\n\\nAs I wasn’t fluent in Spanish, and was definitely not good enough to keep up with 2 people from the motherland, I didn’t catch much of what was said between them. However, I caught one sentence; “¡Es un marica!” (Translation: “ he is a (insert 3 letter derogatory term for gay person here).” \\n\\nMy head snapped up, and I looked at them, “¿Disculpe? Como me llamaste?” (Translation: “Excuse me? What did you call me?”) I reply, kinda shocked.\\n\\nThey immediately backpedaled, saying they were talking about a friend of theirs, and I went back to finishing their transaction. I tell them the total, they hand me the cash, and, as I’m handing them the receipt and change, I put on my best customer service Voice and say, “Have a nice day, and No soy un idiota.” (Translation: I’m not an idiot). \\n\\nApparently, they took this as an insult, so they called the store, and demanded I lose my job for “insulting customers”. Fortunately, I had an awesome manager who knew Spanish enough to bail me out, as she was married to a Cuban. \\n\\nCue Pro Revenge: I had requested a meeting with this manager, the ladies, my coworker, and myself. The ladies got to speak first, saying I called them “See you next Tuesday’s”, and female dogs, and all kinds of things. After they finished their rant, my coworker chimed in and said, “that’s not what he said at al. He only responded when they called him a (word for gay person), and only then, all he asked them was what did they call him. \\n\\nHere’s where it got really interesting. Due to my coworker being right there, bagging, he understood everything else they said prior to me calling them out. Something along the lines of my coworker and I being “intimate” with each other, said that we were probably spreading HIV on their groceries and stuff by just bagging them, and called him the N word(he’s black). \\n\\n“And what did you say at the end of the transaction?” My manager prodded. \\n\\n“Have a nice day and No soy un idiota.” I responded. \\n\\n“Seems to me that I have a couple of racists on my hands.” She said, looking at us and winking. She then grabbed her radio. “Chuck, can you send the AP police liaison to the back office?” (Chuck, being our Asset Protection, or AP, manager). \\n\\nWithin minutes, a local cop was walking into the office. “Officer, can you take these older ladies out of here, get their picture, and explain to them that if they are caught on our property again, they will be charged with criminal trespassing? They speak Spanish mostly, though.” The manager said, then repeated it in flawless Spanish. \\n\\nMy coworker and I got sent back to work, and there was a new sign by my register that read, “15 items or fewer. Any noncompliance will be refused.”',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This got removed from /pettyrevenge for whatever reason, so i figured i would post it here.  \\n\\nThis is the tale of me and my then boyfriend (now husband) back in 2006. You see, he had this bad habit of smoking and drinking a diet coke instead of water. His skin looked bad for his age and I kept urging him to try to drink water for his health. Anyways, he wouldn\\'t budge. He would say: \"there\\'s water in the diet coke already\" and i just felt defeated. Now on to the revenge:\\n\\nThe worst thing you could do to him is to send him to the grocery store. Any grocery store. He absolutely hates it with a passion and if he sees an entitled brat throwing a fit, he will just walk away empty handed so needless to say, I did all the shopping.  Since he never helped me with the grocery shopping, I figured i could save some money and get him to kick his bad habit.  \\n\\nI had an idea: the next time I went grocery shopping, I bought only 1 diet coke and not the 6 packs i usually get. When he asked about it, i told him: \"didn\\'t you hear? it was all over the news! Diet coke is so bad, that they won\\'t make it anymore, this was all i could get\".\\n\\nHe freaked the heck out. A week went by and I got him drinking home-made ice tea so that he could at least get some caffeine. Eventually he started drinking lots and lots of ice water, and since he never shopped at a grocery/convenience store, he was none the wiser.\\n\\nIt took him 3 months to find out that i lied! \\n\\nOne day he stopped to get gas, and when the machine wasn\\'t accepting his card, he stepped in to the convenience store to pay, and that\\'s when he bought all the Diet coke that they had. We laugh about it now, because in those 3 months, his skin got much better, he quit smoking and got into exercising, so he looked/felt great. Now he only drinks a Diet coke about once a month, and i\\'m so glad he wasn\\'t even mad at me.',\n",

I have this friend called Aaron who has the attention span of a man on LSD going down a water slide whilst masturbating. Normally I'm fine with Aaron as he's fun to hang around, but he started talking and making stupid faces in order to get me to laugh during my presentation, and low and behold I do, causing me to lose 10% of my final grade due to poor speaking skills.\\n\\nSo, I started planing, his turn was next and i though of the best way to fuck with him, but my mind was blank.\\n\\nThen it was his turn, he stood up and started handing out pamphlets to everyone. This was when an idea formed in my mind.\\n\\nAs he started talk, I stared right into his eyes and started slowly eating the paper holding eye contact the entire time. He couldn't look away and the unease in his voice was obvious with even a voice crack at one point.\\n\\nHe lost 10% as well, in what I call an epic gamer move.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '\\nSo my wife is a unique being. She is an introvert who has many friends who she loves but she cannot deal with groups. She’s also a person who doesn’t let people walk all over her. We lived with four housemates in a huge house (important later) She doesn’t go to parties and makes it clear to everyone that she doesn’t like big groups of people even when she likes everyone.  \\n\\nBut they didn’t listen. \\n\\nWhen she was about eight months pregnant and as she would say, lumbering around the house like a starving bear in search of Nutella or peace and quiet, (she knew it was only a matter of time before she had none) she found an invite to a baby shower that a housemate left lying around. It was for her.  \\n\\nShe cornered me fuming—did I not know her well enough to know that she hates parties? And surprises? And especially surprise parties?\\nI assured her that I also knew nothing of it—just as her phone rang.  \\n\\nIt was the friend who was hosting the party. “We still on for dinner tonight?”  \\n\\nShe had a look on her face that I hadn’t seen before (but funny enough, many times since our kids were born.).\\n\\nShe told her everything was on and she would see her tonight. (The host was to pick her up and bring her to her house for dinner.). \\n\\nAfter she hung up she asked me where the water balloons and squirt guns were. (Yes we owned these things, we were young and summers get hot.). \\n\\nAngry that her friends disregarded her need for small gatherings and her hate of surprises combined with the insanity that is pregnancy (don’t hate me, I love her and she agreed she was a hormonal beast) she made a plan.  \\n\\nShe went to the party with a water balloon safety pinned to her breaches under her skirt and a safety pin open in her hand.  \\n\\nBoth of us had small water pistols in our pockets.  \\n\\nAs she walked into the dining room, everyone shouted, “Surprise!”  \\n\\nShe stood “in shock” and then touched the pin to the balloon.  \\n\\nSuddenly water busts from under her skirt and pools on the floor. Someone on the background asked the midwife who attended, “can that actually happen?”\\nSeriously. In those words.  \\n\\nThen we pull out the water guns and start shooting them all in the face, but they barely responded. They were all in shock.  \\n\\nShe laughed so hard I was a bit worried. No one else was laughing. They were seriously afraid. Someone started calling 911 but I stopped them.  \\n\\nThey tried to get her to sit down. She explained that her water didn’t break, she just hates surprise parties because they make her feel exactly like they felt right then.  \\n\\nSuffice it to say, with the next pregnancy she had no party, just friends stopping by with gifts one at a time.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I saw this subreddit on Vincey's channel on YouTube and thought I had a fairly decent story to add: \\n\\nSo my dad is very irresponsible with money. To be fair, growing up, he owned his own business and it had very intense fluctuations from year to year so I'm sure anyone would have struggled at least a bit with money management in that situation (I think his best year when I was in the household was about $120k and his worst was about $15k). He was the sole breadwinner our family with me, my brother, and my Mom until the housing crisis in 2008 hit my dad's business hard and my mom took up a part-time job to help out. \\n\\nBut don't go feeling too sorry for him. As I said, he's very bad with money. My mom had a hard job trying to keep him reined in from spending everything during the good years and not saving any of it for the bad years. We'd go from fancy vacations, convertibles, and new expensive hobbies for my dad one year to being told that there wasn't enough money to buy me new clothes despite the ones I had not fitting and having holes in the crotch. Not to mention the anxiety of my parents telling me we might go homeless at any moment. But when my mom asked him to limit his spending, he would pout and just NOT DO WORK until he got his way. And since he owned his own business, if he wasn't working he just wasn't making money. So he usually got his way. \\n\\nDuring my dad's early career when he consistently wasn't making as much, and I was very young (about 4 or 5 maybe) he made friends with one of his clients who was a rich, old, wealthy lady. The way my dad tells it, she essentially unprompted offered to pay for my and my brother's education via a 529 account (essentially she would pay the cost of public college tuition now and it would be worth an entire public college tuition when we were ready to go to school). On just my dad's word I'd be worried he tricked or manipulated an old lady, but I later met her kids and they all seemed cool with it as well. Apparently for weird tax/etc reasons it's usually not a good idea to put the 529 in the child's name. Most people put it in both the parents' names, but this old lady even then said she 'didn't trust' my dad and put it in my mom's name. Thank goodness she did. \\n\\nSo time came for me to go to college, and I ended up getting a merit-based full-tuition scholarship to a very good public school. I decided to go there of course, which meant that my 529, which was primarily for tuition but could be used at its original value for room and board and/or other education purposes, was a bit more open to debate on its use. My parents said they had no money whatsoever saved for my or my brother's college education (which again, is kind of a slap in the face after seeing them literally invest $40k in a close friend's business scheme and lose it all, and vacation to Florida six times in one year alone after my brother and I moved out of the house, but yeah sure you guys have no money for your kids' education) so for room and board I used a mixture of the 529, a part-time job, and my grandpa who kindly offered to help me out because he didn't want to see me have to spend my entire 529 on room and board.\\n\\nAfter graduating, I did have some money left over in my 529, about 10k. I started casually talking to my dad about investing it in my retirement since such an early investment would have a lot of growth over the years. To my complete shock, my dad says 'That money isn't yours, it's in your mom's name. You're done with your education so the rest of it is for us.' What. The. Fuck. Seriously??? If they had helped out ONE CENT with my education, sure, I could see the justification, but they literally let me stress out over barely having enough to get by while they vacationed over and over. They had NOTHING to do with my education, the nerve of him to think that he was owed anything blew my mind. But legally, I had no leg to stand on, and I was furious. \\n\\nSo I turned to my mom and tried to talk to her about it without my dad around. She agreed with me, but she was afraid of what my dad would do if he found out she gave me the money. Luckily, she handles the accounts, and my dad is apparently so irresponsible and far-removed from the money that goes in and out of the accounts that my mom was able to secretly give me 10k without him even noticing it's gone. I invested it all in my retirement and it's growing beautifully. Several years have gone by and he still hasn't noticed. \\n\\nSo now that my parents are reaching retirement age, my dad has finally realized that having no money saved for retirement means that you can't retire. He's complaining about how the system has cheated him and he'll have to work until he dies blah blah blah, but honestly it's really satisfying to me to finally see his actions catch up to him. I do feel sorry for my mom, but lucky for her she's apparently been secretly saving small bits of their income for years with an account my dad doesn't know about and does have a small stash for retirement. I almost hope they divorce so that she's able to retire on it without having to help him out, but they're very religious so that probably won't happen. It's just a relief to be financially independent from all that crap and know that my dad can't get to me or my money anymore. His spending habits have infuriated me for years and he's never really had to face the consequences until now, and I guess for me that's my revenge. In case it isn't obvious, I will NOT be helping them out with retirement. Screw that.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Some people from r/pettyrevenge suggested I post this here:\\n\\nThis happened over 20 years ago.\\n\\nI was a student living in a rented house with 4 other people. It was an old draughty house that was owned by this absent-to-us owner, who let his son collect rent every month. They lived on the same street, a few houses away. I believe they had more property they were renting out, but I’m not sure.\\n\\nAnyway, there were two incidents:\\n\\nFirstly, there was some freak hailstorm at night where golfball-sized hail stones broke my window, and destroyed the skylight portion of the kitchen. The entire neighbourhood was full of slush and damaged cars that were parked outside. It was a pretty large-scale occurrence where you could see the house and car damage in that area a number of years after.\\n\\nWe approached the landlord to fix the windows and skylight, and all they did was nail wooden planks and tape cardboard on my window, and did the same to the skylight. They hired service people to replace their own broken windows of their house days after the hailstorm.\\n\\nThe house we were staying in just got colder and draftier as it was in the winter.\\n\\nSecondly, my housemate kept two of his road bicycles in the garage, and one Friday he went in to prep them for the weekend. Thieves had broken the lock on the doors leading to the back alley, and taken these somewhat nice and expensive bikes.\\n\\nHe was really pissed. So he took the owner to small claims court, and managed to get monetary compensation out of it after a few months of the process.\\n\\nThat’s when the owner’s son decided that he was not going rent out the house to us. He said it had nothing to do with the outcome of the small claims court, yeah right.\\n\\nWe had a month to vacate.\\n\\nHalf of the garage was sectioned off by some corrugated metal sheets, and one day I slipped through in-between and got to the other half to see what was in there, and was surprised at the BMW series 3 being stored in that side.\\n\\nI felt a mixture of anarchy and apathy built up as I had been freezing all winter because of the state of the boarded-up window.\\n\\nI used a wire coat hanger to get into the car, and then brought the garden hose and soaked the interior, including the trunk. I didn’t overflow it but it would certainly squelch if you touched any of the fabric upholstery, including the headrests. I then left everything looking like I was never there.\\n\\nI wish I could say there was any outcome I witnessed, but that didn’t happen. We all moved out and got our deposits back. I dropped contact with the others, so they wouldn’t even have known how to reach me if there was a problem.\\n\\nIt just felt good at that time.\\n\\nTLDR: Landlord did not fix damaged window/skylight from a bad hail storm in winter, and housemate had his two road bikes stolen, so I hosed down their BMW in storage.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hi, so I’ll try and make this not super long but I’ll start us off. I heard this story at dinner with my mom, she was telling me about this since I use discord a lot, and she has found it to be a good place to find friends, she fancied this Server about a streamer, not sure who but someone, the server had around 1,300 members? I’m not sure but it had around that, there was two sections for under 18 and above 18 so both ages were allowed, however one day my mom gets asked by a 15 year old if they can talk to her since she is a adult, she was a little scared at first since she doesn’t dm minors, however the kid needed help, it seemed one of the mods of this server was sexually harassing him. My mom was shocked and told him to tell him to stop or block him, but a week later he still needs help, my mom ends up talking to the Owner and sends screenshots (sadly this was only part of the convo for the kid because mod deleted his side of the convo to protect his own ass) and the owner agrees she will ban him in the morning. A day later she changed her mind saying the kid started to whole mess by “flirting” with him, however no evidence was presented besides “his word” and ended up doing nothing, The Whole staff team ended up siding with him. So the revenge, this is really my mom getting revenge for the kid but, she ended up posting the screenshots in a image general chat, the staff didn’t notice for hours what she did, she left and informed her friends what happened, within a hour 400-500 people had left and that was the active people as time went by the server now has less than 1,000 members! This server was made for a twitch streamer so kinda a fan server, so? Well my mom talked to this streamer via Instagram and he left it, what’s worse? Better yet hilarious for us, the Pedo mod and the streamer were close friends and were planning a big vacation to New York, after news broke out The streamer cancelled the vacation and dropped contact with that mod. So at the end of the day, the server was dead and only had admins and mods talking there, for who remained they were inactive people.\\n\\nTL:DR: My mom gets revenge for a kid getting sexually harassed online and causes staff of the server who protected him to cause the whole server to die and end up ruining the pedophiles relationship with a semi famous streamer.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Please do not copy or repost. \\n\\nThis took place nearly 30 years ago. \\n\\nComing home from work one night (gas station job) to find my husband sitting on the steps with a bag packed. He had lied and he was having an affair, her husband discovered them, and he was leaving. \\n\\nPart 1. \\n\\nWe agreed on how to split up our vehicles and our otherwise perfect diesel car he got suddenly had major $$$ issues... My vehicle continued to run perfectly. \\n\\nPart 2. \\nOver time he ended up buying back out home (it wasn't suitable for a rental suite and I needed a different place. \\n \\n In the time between, I had gotten a dog and a cat... And we went away on vacation. When we came back we discovered the pet sitter had passed fleas onto our pets and with a limited budget, I did my best as a single mom to rid our place. When we moved they seemed gone as we didn't have anyone issues. But apparently, they were waiting for his mistress... She was highly sensitive and bled with every bite... Can we say attack fleas?!?\\n\\nPart 3. \\nMy ex had decided that he would try and add a bathroom downstairs, with the idea of a room for rent for me as a single mom, but he never finished... However, he did open up the sewer drain for the toilet... And if you haven't already guessed, in came a giant rat. Now, just before we moved I had figured the kitten or pup were getting into the garbage and tearing at it and had chewed a leather purse strap... But that was as close as it came (thankfully as my kids were 2, 3 and 5). After we left it decided the home was free reign. \\nThen ended up shootng it mega times with a pellet gun and it more than filled an adult size shoebox. \\n\\nMy girlfriend joked, a rat for a rat... \\n\\nGod says vergence is Mine and He certainly can do it a lot better than me!!!\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Kinda a long one, but hope you enjoy. \\n\\nI worked in a machine shop many many years ago and thought this would be a good story for here. I started as part time and moved up to full time. I was running CMC lathes and other high end equipment. One day one of the other employees that worked in the shipping department was in a motorcycle accident and broke his wrist so he cold not do his normal job for a while. Because I had some experience there working my way up there they asked me to cover while he got better. \\n\\nIt's been a month and they moved him to another department since he was on lifting restrictions permanently and I am stuck in the shipping department. There was more of an opportunity to make more money running the machines vs working shipping. In the short time in the shipping area I had increased the accuracy of the department so much that they actually received a letter from headquarters saying as much. I found this out from a supervisor friend and he said they didn't really want me to know this information to avoid paying me more. \\n\\nSo the sign up sheet showed up to run the machines and I asked my supervisor if I signed up would I even be considered for one of the positions. He told me to hold off that he needed to speak to a couple of people and would get back to me. Well the sign up sheet vanished and I asked him about it and he told me I should have signed up and he never told me to not sign up. \\n\\nI was working overtime every day to keep up with the shipping demands and was short handed since one of my helpers was either 2-3 hours late every day or didn't show up. The part time help was about useless since they didn't seem to be able to read English and messed up orders constantly. The part time help come to me and said they couldn't lift a box to ship it. I picked up the box and put it on the scale  233lbs.......UPS would only take boxes up to 150lbs. I didn't notice how strong I had gotten picking up the boxes and tossing them around all day. These were brass, bronze, and stainless steel industrial valves so they were not light. \\n\\nI kept going to my supervisor and telling him I needed help. This workload was becoming too much for me. I had days were I arrived at 4am and worked until 6pm lifting and packing these valves to ship out. I have a strong work ethic and if I am asking for help then I need it. Not help arrived. \\n\\nHere is where the pro revenge comes in by accident. I started to notice I was having issues lifting and moving my shoulder. I had to go to their workers comp doctor and literally spent a year in therapy while doing my job with my shoulder not getting better. They finally gave up and gave me an MRI. I had torn my rotator cup and had a piece of chipped bone in the joint. It was a year of pain, pills, needles that could have been avoided. \\n\\nSo my surgery happened and I was off work for a while. I did have to go and pick up my paycheck with my arm immobilized to my chest. I walked by my shipping department and about busted out laughing. My supervisor was there, along with one of our engineers, the very elder owner of the company, 2 of the front desk secretaries, and 2 other employees trying to do what I was normally do in a day. The place was a complete disaster, trays of parts were beyond maxed out, trash everywhere, people tripping over each other........it was so funny to watch. I have never had that kind of mess even on my busiest days there. \\n\\nI left the company since I didn't trust them to not to hire more people to help me out. I did find out from my supervisor friend that after I left main headquarters send a team out to completely restructure the whole department. I guess they learned when I said I need help I really mean it. I didn't mind the workers comp settlement either which tied me through my shoulder getting healed and getting a better job.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': '“If you want me out of here, you’re gonna have to try harder than weeping over a body that no longer contains a soul” Alright then -snif-\\n\\nSo tomorrow marks twenty years since my first wife passed at the hands of an arrogant doctor or two, and I truly respect and love and appreciate almost every nurse I encountered in this process. There was one nurse I didn’t appreciate so much. \\n\\nThere was this male nurse (awesome, I wanted to be a nurse at one time) who, when my wife was in dying in ICU, took it upon himself to say to me as I leaned on her body prayer-style “You know there’s no point in praying for her right now, her soul is gone already and is already where it’s going to be”. I stopped my light sobbing to (presumably) have a quizzical look on my face as I sat up saying “Are you serious right now?!” He walked away.\\n\\nAbout five minutes later I walk by him talking with another, clearly more experienced nurse as he says to her “I was just trying to tell him the truth….bla bla bla” . \\n\\nSo now towards the end of visiting hours I see him walk by and pray, for the first time, that this dude doesn’t stop in. In the doorway, as my wife’s ankles start turning inward, he says “You know if you want me out of here tonight you’re gonna have to try harder than weeping over a body that no longer contains a soul”. Friggin wow. \\n\\nI get up, tears rolling down my eyes, and see the awesome more experienced nurse smoking outside (I needed air). I start talking to her and just start breaking down. She hugs me. I cry harder, and then mention how a nurse could say that right now. She stops me and says “What !? Did he enter your room? He was instructed not..”\\n\\n“He said it in the doorway, so technically no…”\\n\\n“Oh don’t you worry you won’t be seeing his flaky ass again I personally guarantee it”\\n\\nShe yelled at him so loud you could hear it all over and he was fired. The experienced nurse, Ruth, was amazing, and was crying as she fired him.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'This happened 20+ years ago. This is a long bumpy story, so buckle up and grab a cold one.  This played out over a six week period. Not exactly a pro revenge, but close.\\n\\nI worked for a well known German engineering/manufacturing company at a subsidiary company here in the US.  Please note, this story is not a dig against Germans, German engineers or Germany, only THESE specific German engineers.\\n\\nOne of the executive VP\\'s in the parent company back in Germany decided that he would start a mini-group in the US under our company, made up of six sons of German exec\\'s that were fledgling engineers, to design and make  a large multi site system to be sold under a development contract to the government to the tune of over $100 million. They designed an elaborately over engineered system as their solution and built a full scale prototype system on the west coast for an operational trial at the customer\\'s site. \\n\\nThere was one problem. It didn\\'t work. It kept stopping and breaking and they didn\\'t know why. They were also too proud and WAY too arrogant to ask for help. The government started complaining to the parent company about the system not working as stated.\\n\\nThis is where myself and another co-worker come in. Out of the entire company, we were the only two that had the specific skill set needed to figure out what was wrong and find a fix.\\n\\nAt the clandestine request of a much higher senior VP in Germany, we were requested to go out under cover  to observe the \"technology\" they had designed, find out what is wrong, and report back directly to our company\\'s president and the German senior exec. VP privately on a daily basis. We fly out.\\n\\nOur arrival was greeted by the senior German engineer (lets call him SGE) on site that lectured us that all communications to / from the site were to go through him to prevent misunderstandings. Period. No exceptions. Also, that he stated \"knowledge is power and power is not to be shared.\" (Exact words.) We almost fell off our chairs. Noted. Reported.\\n\\nWe proceeded to go talk to our on-site maintenance personnel. Found out that the six engineers wouldn\\'t listen to their observations...they were \"ENGINEERS\" and knew much better than simple techs.  (These were our best highly skilled technicians.) Noted. Listed our techs observed issues and reported. \\n\\nWe used specialized test equipment to monitor the system and determined what the communications issues were. (This took several days.) We asked the German communications engineer (lets call him GCE) if the comm equipment vendor had any custom test equipment or software we could use; he said no. By accident a week later, we ran into the comm equipment vendor\\'s engineer and found out that our GCE had lied, and that it was obvious to them he had no idea how the comm equipment worked.  Reported. \\n\\nWe devised a fix which would take multiple steps over 6-7 days. After the second day, a marked improvement was apparent. Our GCE, not to be out done, repeated what we had done to \"make it better.\" It did not. Worse. Much worse. Noted. Reported.\\n\\nListened to a 1 hour lecture from lead engineer on how this was our fault.  Noted. Reported.\\n\\nMy coworker and I custom designed fixes for system and installed. Not perfect, but 95% improvement. Our German comm engineer tries to take the credit for the fix.  Noted. Reported.\\n\\nThe remaining issues were mechanical design issues that would require major design rework. After we returned back to our home office, it was decided to shut down the test system, bring the six engineers and the engineering mini system to our facilities for the design rework. One of our company\\'s senior engineers (a good friend) was assigned to oversee the rework design.\\n\\nBy now I had more than my fill of our German engineer\\'s,their arrogant attitude and behavior. Even though we were engineers, we weren\\'t \"German\" engineers and had been treated as less than  lackey\\'s and morons. Here is where the pro revenge comes in.\\nRemember our six German engineers had no idea we had been reporting directly to a much senior Exec. VP than they did.\\n\\nThe senior exec German VP, (our \"visitor\") that had requested us to investigate the issues with the system, had flown over to both meet us and to observe the  system redesign. His visit was intentionally unannounced. He met with myself and my co-worker first along with our company engineering VP. We discussed what we observed and our recommended fixes.\\n\\nOur \"visitor\" then asked if I would take him over to the design building where the engineering system was. This was also where our six German system engineers were located. As we walked into the engineering office area, the SGE was clearly heard loudly spouting off to our company\\'s project engineer about how he was in charge of everything and nothing was to be changed on HIS system without HIS review and approval, and no one else knew enough to work properly on HIS system. This tirade continued for several minutes. When he finished,  I introduced our \"visitor\" by name but not by title. He obviously didn\\'t know who our visitor was. After a short walk around the engineering system, we left for a company picnic out on the front lawn. \\n\\nOur \"visitor\" sat down with us at the picnic a bit later and informed us that the six German engineers would be returning to Germany that evening and would be terminated with cause after 30 days. Note that in Europe, this is equivalent to a permanent career termination. Later that afternoon, I saw the SGE packing his stuff and wished him and his group a nice trip home. No response.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Doubt anyone will but please don’t replicate  this post. \\n\\n\\nKaren is overused. I’m calling this bitch Brenda. This happened a while ago so I feel like I can finally tell it. \\n\\n\\nMobile, sorry. \\n\\n\\n\\nFor background, I had been working at an incredibly competitive financial institution, without proper credentials (ie everyone has a finance degree, internships, letters behind names, big schools, whereas I had basically an English lit degree from a no name liberal arts college). \\n\\n\\nWithin this firm, I worked my ass off to dig my way out of retail phones into a very competitive section of the company (not providing details, not relevant, but it’s the place everyone wants to be, so it’s hard to get into). \\n\\n\\nI spent one year in an intro level team within this area, and then I somehow managed to obtain my “dream job” at the time. I jumped two levels to get this role (big deal at my company) and additionally, this is a role typically given to people with major finance background (you have to know investments). \\n\\n\\nI had worked hard, learned a lot of a product everyone else hates (so I’m marketable), came with stellar recommendations, and a manager decided to take a gamble on me! \\n\\n\\nI was SO excited for this job. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I may have worked at a big firm but we were at the ‘satellite’ smaller site, not the headquarters so my local group was pretty small. Think 60 people at the time. Everyone knows everyone. \\n\\n\\nMy promotion is announced via email, but my old team isn’t releasing me for a month (normal) so I have a little time before I start. Just like usual, we all have work happy hours. I start hearing about this woman Brenda, on my new team (of only 4 people total, including me) and how I need to be very very careful. I remember being perplexed because people couldnt really explain what they meant. I just kept hearing, “she’s psycho. Avoid.” \\n\\n\\nAnyways, day 1 starts and I am seated directly to her right. There was a stupid open floor plan, I was on the end of the row of the 4 of us, and since we dealt with sensitive info, we’re glassed in. Basically it’s glass, then “Joe,” “Carl,” “Brenda,” then me (were also back to back with 4 others, two chicks that I’m still friends with to this day because of our bonded trauma. Haha half kidding). \\n\\n\\nBasically we’re trapped in this corner with this crazy woman. \\n\\n\\nOn the other side of us, there’s a walk way. On the other side of this aisle are the big whigs. The money makers. The guys we all want to be. 5 feet away. Our management team sat 4 rows away out of earshot (truthfully because theyre scared of product and don’t want to look stupid but that’s a story for another time). This floor is loud. Phones going at  all times. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ll spare you the early interactions with Brenda, but let’s just say my friend’s warnings were on point.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrenda was that rare combo of bad at her job AND horrible human being. Brenda was CONVINCED Joe, Carl, and I were out to get her. Me, specifically. She had files on all of us. Every time we’d open our mouths, she’d pull her keys off her lanyard around her neck (no one wears lanyards, this is a very professional institution), unlock her drawer, pull out her file on whichever one of us spoke, and vigorously wrote notes. \\n\\n\\n\\nTo provide another example, one morning she lost her phone (she was ~50 years and had a flip phone. This was not that long ago. We literally all had iPhones). Brenda was absolutely CONVINCED we’d stolen her phone. We’re all looking at her in absolute disbelief as she’s actually YELLING at us. It was in her car. \\n\\n\\n\\nThen there was the time she called out when her “microwave broke” (what? Go buy a new one. They’re $30…). She sent text updates throughout the day of her tremendous microwave ordeal before, I shit you not, bringing in the broken pieces of the fucking microwave into the office and insisting on showing each of us the issues. (Bitch we have shit to do). \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyways, you get the point. This woman is absolutely nuts. So as time\\nProgressed, I worked my ass off and started getting really really good at my job. The money makers were impressed with me and I was getting invited into crazy meetings that I shouldn’t have ever been privy too. I was getting tapped for a promotion. Honestly, this was the dream. \\n\\n\\nWell, Brenda, you remember sucks at her job. The problem this, in this role, some of our deadlines are anywhere from 41 to 3 minutes. I’m not kidding. That 3 minute deadline is a massive deal and we can miss out on lots of money if that is missed. You can’t screw on this job \\n\\n\\n\\nAs stated earlier, the money makers learned to trust me and basically I had to run every single process that was important/impactful because she couldn’t be trusted. It got so bad at one point, I had to have her run that 3 minute process because I had a meeting and upon leaving the meeting, I find the head of all the money makers literally standing in the door to the glassed in area yelling “PhuckingPhabulous, Brenda fucked up x process. I need you now!”\\n\\n\\nThat 3 minute process’s deadline was FORTY-FIVE MINUTES prior!! I literally had to sprint downstairs (thank god the team I need is below us) and figure out wtf is going on. I get the numbers from them, run back up the stairs and get my dev to manually load them into the back end and force them into the front end so the money makers can get on with their day. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProblem solved right? The second mgmt walked away after praising my “quick, out of the box thinking,” she stood up and started screaming at me how I keep taking over HER job and I’m a “HORRIBLE PERSON AND A HORRIBLE COWORKER” and I’m “trying to ruin her.”  I calmly said “sorry Brenda. When Head Money Maker asks me to do something I do it.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis became a twice a week thing. She’d wait till mgmt left, then would start screaming at me. At one point I got the hat trick- I offended her 3 times in one week and was reported to HR three times in one week. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI know you’re all wondering, where the fuck is HR? Of course I went to HR! But guess what - i shit you not. They told me that since  she never screamed at me in front of mgmt (our mgmt and money maker mgmt- bitch was smart) they couldn’t prove it happened. Even thought easily 8+ people had reported various incidents and I gave names of people who would back me up. They never called anyone on my list btw. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy manager had had it. She believed me. Let’s call her Sara. Sara told me (offline over drinks) that she was doing everything in her power to terminate this woman and that HR was giving her bullshit left and right. Basically moving goal posts. She’d complete one requirement for termination, then HR would create 4 more. Honestly, and I say this as a woman, I think it’s because she was over 50 and female in a male dominated environment. Some bullshit right there. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyways, Sara told me she’s got the interpersonal HR angle down but since she doesn’t know finance (all mgmt didn’t. Fucking stupid. that’s why they avoided our products.) asked if I could quietly provide “data that proved she could have incurred tangible losses to the company if I hadn’t caught her mistakes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay, I had to think. Obviously that 3 minute issues was easy low hanging fruit. Documented that. Found a few other things but nothing big enough (this is a big shop so to actually make an impactful error, it’s gotta be big). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally I had it. I knew what process she needed to screw up that I could use. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTime to hatch the plan. I always owned the process so I needed to figure out how to get out of doing it and give it to her. Same time, every day. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFortunately for me, I had been asked to participate in recruitment (I’m one of only 3 women in the glassed in room so I’m usually involved with recruitment for obvious reasons. besides, it’s something I enjoy). \\n\\n\\n\\nI was able to get the recruitment meetings scheduled twice a week during that process (process takes 15, meeting was an hour.) \\n\\n\\n\\nI teach her the process, she starts taking it Tuesday and Thursday during my meetings and I wait.  \\n\\n\\nSure enough, only took about 3 weeks before completely forgot to run the process, meaning she left yesterday’s numbers. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFuck me. This is what I was waiting for. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo to explain this process, basically every day, for this specific product, we wait until these daily rates are loaded to the public, then we pull them into our systems and our “money makers” base their day’s transactions on these numbers. If the numbers change, day over day, that obviously impacts how they transact. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo. I took the rates from the day she didn’t update (ie the prior day) and then I started googling to see if I could find the biggest market movement for that specific product in history. \\n\\n\\nThen I ran my math. If the market had dropped from the rates she had left overnight in error, to the same level they dropped on that historical day in history, the calculated loss was about ~22 million based on the transaction completed the day she didn’t update. \\n\\n\\n\\nI pulled my boss into an office, showed her my entire file (I had an entire file of small issues to back everything up) but at the end I dropped the ~$22million on her. I explained that it’s a completely valid possibility, because I used historically documented data. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was it. The end was actually pretty tumultuous. Brenda finally lost her mind on me screaming at me, in front of my manager. She actually bellowed “I can’t work this literally terrible human being. She’s out to fucking get me and I won’t STAND FOR THIS. FIRE HER FIRE HER.”  I’m talking full blown screaming. \\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the one and only time I lost my temper. Verbatim said “fuck this shit im going to HR.” (Id asked to have my desk moved 10+ times but now I was demanding it).  HR wasn’t even there. They didn’t get in till 9. Two hours later for fucks sake. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyways, she wasn’t allowed back at work after that. Two weeks later my boss calls me to meet her at bar. \\n\\n\\nBrenda was gone. My ~22$million loss predication was backed by the head money maker when HR asked him if it was valid.\\n\\n\\nMy boss had created a 92 page report highlighting all the interpersonal issues, etc. everything HR wanted. She told the 22mill was really the nail in the coffin. \\n\\n\\n\\nI did it. And kept my fucking dream job. Fuck you, Brenda. I won.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus: she actually tried to re enter the campus 8 months later stating “she never got her sweater back”. (She did. Company makes departed employees sign receipt of all possessions). The week she was threatening, I was required to be escorted two and from my car the entire week by security along with one of the money makers she hated. (She fake fainted once when he asked why she fucked up and was carried out in a stretcher but that’s a story for another time. )',\n",

I left that hellhole shortly after and am about to celebrate 20 years with my current employer.\\n\\nTL/DR Office bully threatens to destroy me, I set in motion a chain of events that see him lose his marriage, his job &amp; (probably) his sanity.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Names are obviously pseudonyms. So let's call this guy Bob. My girlfriend, Joy, is transgender, and back when she was younger, she was bullied mercilessly for being a 'sissy' and an effeminate boy in school. Bob was one of the apex assholes and physically assaulted Joy many times on top of lots of name calling and slurs.\\n\\nFast forward many years later, Bob approaches Joy (now transitioned and on HRT) asking her to sign a phone contract. We were still very young at that point in time so we didn't know that it was a phone line scam where he'd go on to spend credits under her name. By law, since it's signed under her name, she was the one liable in reimbursing the amount to the telco companies.\\n\\nWe used a friend's phone, pretended to be a random girl called Veronica (picture taken from Google) and texted Bob. He was dumb to the point where he totally fell for it and didn't even bother to reverse image search the profile photo. So, we learned that he was wanted for drugs and on the run from the cops hence scamming people so he could shack up in random hotels. \\n\\nHe ended up lusting after/falling for 'Veronica' and giving us information about his whereabouts. Of course, we just informed the police.\\n\\nSoon, Bob was ambushed and arrested. Joy was called in to positive ID him along with some other suspected crooks involved in the same phone scam ring-- she saw a few ex-bullies of hers and just positive ID-ed them.\\n\\nMost of them got 3-5 years in prison and a few lashes of the cane. Where I'm from, the punishment for certain crimes are extremely brutal caning. It's so forceful that one swing splits your butt vertically in half.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Righting on mobile soo sorry for any bad grammar or formatting.\\n\\nTLDR bus driver refused to allow me on, I contacted his employers and got him fired.\\n\\nBackstory, this was about 1 and a half years ago, I was 18 at the time (important to the story). On the day I had been kicked out of my house soo was a bit stressed.\\n\\nTo the story, in the UK we have UGO tickets (under 19 tickets, cheaper), you have to state your birthday to by the tickets and I never had an issue just some asking if I had ID (usually I didn\\'t). \\n\\nThe first incident M (me 18M looks 25), BD (bus driver around 50M). \\nM: \"can I have a UGO ticket please\"\\nBD: \"what\\'s your birthday\"\\nM: \"Friday 13(I love bringing this up), month, 2001(this was 2019)\"\\nBD: \"that would make you 19, I\\'ll have to give you a adult ticket\"\\nObviously I argue, he says I\\'ll need ID but have to buy a adult ticket today. I had my birth certificate(government form of ID) in my bag and he said his company doesn\\'t accept that as proof of ID. I get off call him an idiot. Wait 30 mins get the next bus and told them what happened (They could do math and let me on), I get their company number and make a complaint. \\n\\nThe incident: he had no reprimand as I had 3 other incidents now as I said I was kicked out this day soo I had all my personal belongings including my passport (I bought it due to this incident and another reason I\\'m not stating) but all in a large bag. Well I had my ticket before getting on the bus here\\'s the dialogue:\\nBD: \"that\\'s not a UGO I hope as we both know you\\'re older than 19\"\\nM: \"I have my passport on me this time but it in my bag\"\\nBus starts driving and I am emptying my bag to get my ID when he says\\nBD: \"you better have it or I\\'m going to have to fine you\"\\nM: \"wait so you\\'re threatening to fine me ... really\"\\nI get my ID and he stops the bus for 5 minutes to look at it like it was a foreign object .Then he goes to hand it back without looking at me.\\nM: \"can I get an apology(honestly I would have dropped it if he did apologize)\"\\nBD: \"It\\'s don\\'t now go to your seat\"\\n\\nWell I get to my dad\\'s home and call his employer again. The dude sounded like he was over the day at that point(felt bad for that guy). I obviously told them the prior incidents with dates and times and him refusing a government ID and apology. Now I did law at college and was GOOD at it soo I threw in that he threatened me with a fine after trying to break my agreement with their company (the pre-purchased ticket, if I have bought it and they haven\\'t checked if I\\'m fit for that purchase before sale, well the company is on the hook for the failed service and any distress caused by that lack of service).\\n\\nAll that said and done, 2 months later I see him at the bus station ... in a taxi. Seems like you don\\'t have to struggle with calculating age but you better be good at calculating change you old bat.\\n\\nOh and the kicker, I\\'ve not used a single bus since then. I walk or run to my destinations now.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So, first of all sorry for my poor formatting, I\\'m on mobile since my pc just died, also sorry for my bad English, not a native speaker.\\n\\nNOW, TO THE STORY OF MY GODDAMN MASTER.\\n\\nI met this guy... Let\\'s call him PenPen, my ex D&amp;D master, 2 years ago, first time master, really brilliant guy at the time, funny, interesting, great narrator for a beginner, and If I say so you can trust me (I get bored really easily).\\n\\nWe have our first adventure together, let\\'s call it \"golden anus\" (literal translation of the funny nickame we gave to the campaign) I was playing with Hazia (thiefling warlock-sorcerer) and later on with Erelith (thiefling warlock, Hazia\\'s sister), that adventure was absolutely majestic, great plot in his simplicity, but like everything in this world we reach an end.\\n\\n\\nFast forward two months and he informs me that he is starting a new campaign (Golden Anus 2) in the same world but a different continents and wanted me to be the second master because he wanted to play from time to time and he knew I wanted to master, GREAT, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS, I WILL MASTER THE SIDEQUESTS YAY.\\nHe also told me that he needed some players because the old party split a bit due to work, school and usual stuff, NOICE, I introduce him my partner, beforehand I told him to be delicate with him because... Well both me and my partner had some pretty heavy stuff on our shoulders and some trauma to deal with, he was ok with this and also offered to put some trigger warning when we were near some heavy stuff, pretty gud.\\nWe start the campaign, the party was:\\n•me: Vavila, thiefling Inkmancer\\n•partner: Gwen, fawn bard\\n•player 3: Vincent, Human Hunter\\n•player 4: Devil, thiefling sorcerer-warrior\\n(Homebrewed stuff)\\n\\n\\nWe start and everything was fine, he master the story and I master my small session (a bonding session in which every player was sealed in an oniric bubble living his own idilliac dream until it became a nightmare that was related to their BG, the memories of those dreams were shared between the characters) everybody was happy.\\n\\n\\nMy boyfriend want to try mastering, he write his own little  adventure and everybody is ready, the party is:\\n •Boyfriend: master \\n •Girlfriend: player cleric\\n(Yup, we are poly) \\n •Me: player inkmancer\\n •PenPen: player \\nWe start creating the sheets, custom and slightly simplified with a bit of spice given by some a shitload of maluses conditions and maluses everybody had.\\nMe and boyfriend start working on PenPen sheet to make it enjoyable but at the same time challenging.\\nSince his character had a really strong special attack (like a +1 longsword, but is actually part of his body, at lv 1) we give him the condition that every time he uses the ability he loses 1 hp, no prob we have an healer in the party and plenty of opportunities to heal.\\n\\nAPPARENTLY NOT.\\n\\nWhen the player hears my proposal for this condition he ask me why.\\nI just explain him that is for a balance reason, since is a little bit OP as an ability we had to keep it balanced.\\nHE MELTS DOWN.\\nHe starts yelling at me and my boyfriend and we are both kinda shocked, we both have some heavy trauma related to yelling and direct aggression, boyfriend starts crying.\\nThis triggers my trauma related to the sound of cry but I keep my Savoir faire and just tell him that his reaction was unacceptable and immature while I try to calm boyfriend while keeping just an extremely cold look at PenPen.\\n\\nIn the end after boyfriend stops crying PenPen says \"it\\'s everything alright, isn\\'t it? Friend as before\" and then he quits, he didn\\'t apologize or anything.\\nWe play in his campaign the following week and I was absolutely livid, my boyfriend decides to participate anyway and we try our best to keep the morale high for the other players.\\n\\nFast forward 3 weeks and he STILL did not apologize and meanwhile we discover from the other players that he was bad-mouthing us to everyone he knew all while ghosting us.\\n\\nAt that point I wasn\\'t only angry, I was angry with interests, is was absolutely livid.\\n\\nYou have to know that I was also the admin of his discord server.\\n\\nThe revenge: I messaged him, told him that all his behaviours until now were completely unacceptable and that his own family problems are not something he can drop on us using us as a punching ball, also that he wasn\\'t absolutely forgiven for that reaction without even an apology, I told him that I didn\\'t wanted to be associated with such a pile of fuming garbage.\\nOnce I sent the message I just annihilated his discord server, removed every room, bot, role and everything.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t a big damage after all, 16 people will not miss a dead discord server related to a dead twitch account but I needed to send a message.\\n\\n\\nAnd... Well, that\\'s all, after almost two months I\\'m still extremely angry and I needed to vent a bit.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'So, I am a cancer researcher and a guest professor at an university\\'s school of medicine, teaching my speciality: Imaging. Besides the usual acquisitions of medical images using MRI, CT, etc... Imaging as a lot to do with image processing. Some days I am just a glorified programmer/IT guy. And as anyone who has ever programmed anything will tell you, coding is a very personal activity. With enough experience, you can tell who wrote what just by looking at the lines. \\n\\nI am also in my late 20\\'s and I am not native to this country and it\\'s my first year has guest professor. So, some students look at me as this inexperienced, gullible, foreign guy. \\n\\nAs part of my module\\'s grading, the students have to submit 2 reports that weight 10% each, of their final grade. These reports are about image processing and they have to code a fair bit.\\n\\nAs usual there are students that make an effort, some do mininal work and then some cheat/copy. As I was grading the reports I notice a small group of students who found reports from previous years online and literally copy+paste those reports, changing only their name. It was a facepalm moment, because those reports were not even good, and had lot of errors.\\n(You see, in order to establish a baseline for my grading, I browsed previous years reports so I knew what to expect from the students of this module.)\\nNaturally I graded them all with 0 and kept working my way through grading the reports I had left.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the students \"casually\" asked me in the halls how were the reports. Off course I can\\'t comment on that until I release the grades. One time, this dude, who has copied from another report (98% match on plagiarism checker) , asks me when will I release the grades and comes with this story that he worked really hard on his reports. That his exam hasn\\'t gone so well and he is hoping that the grade on his reports are enough to get a pass. \\n\\nI mean, submitting another person\\'s work as your own is very wrong, but it was an online submission and impersonal. Right now he was just lying through his teeth and to my FACE. I could feel my blood boiling, but I didn\\'t lost my composure and decide to come up with a plan: \\n\\nI knew that my exam was the last exam of the semester and that after that the students usually go home or family vacations while they wait for their grades to be posted online. So I graded the exams and input their grades into my excel with their report grades. 4 students had zero due to cheating on their reports and if I graded their reports with 50% of the max grade they would BARELY FAIL the module. But they would fail nonetheless. So, It. Was. On! \\n\\n(In order to be fair I bumped everyone else\\'s grades, a bunch of people with miserable reports ended up barely passing because of my grade bump. But, eventhough their reports were bad, it was their own work and not copied from anywhere) \\n\\nYou see, students are entitled to make an appointment to review their grades after publishing and before the grades are locked for the year. Basically, they sit with me, we go through their exam and reports and their goal is to convince me to \"give\" them extra points in hope that they pass the module.\\n\\nI knew the cheaters would come, after all, they think they fooled me once already, and they still have half the report\\'s points to bargain for. So I just waited for their emails.\\n\\nLo and behold, they write me the same day the grades go online, saying how hard they have worked on their reports and that they don\\'t understand how they only got 50%. And that they wanted an appointment. I was ecstatic! Sure, let\\'s review your grades!!\\n\\n Do you remember that my exam was the last one? Well, they were already on vacations... some very far away... and begged me for an online appointment. No can do... university policy. Moreover you have 3 days to show for you appointment, otherwise the grades are locked, also university policy. \\n\\nSo here they come, cutting their vacations short and catching planes, some spent hours in buses and trains to make it on time. \\n\\nI know what many of you are thinking: they come, I show them the plagiarism checker results and reveal that I know that is not their work and send them on their way... well, I considered it but I had something better in mind. Those appointments usually take 10 min, I show them their work with my notes on what\\'s wrong/right and they try to find some inconsistencies in my grading and bargain for more points. I ain\\'t giving you the opportunity. Mhuahahah!!\\n\\nSo, one by one they sit with me individually. And I go through their exam and reports...remember that they copied the reports? And copied bad ones, with a lot of errors... I ask questions, lots of them: \"why did you do this?\" , \"what is your reasoning for this?\" - they don\\'t know... it\\'s no their work... they mumble random stuff, because they don\\'t know what to answer...\\n\\nPoint by point, mistake by mistake, I explain why it was wrong, how it should be done, lecturing the same material that they had already been lectured on during class... I make it long, I make it boring... I make it painfull... I spent hours with each one of them throughout those 3 days. They always came with the same, \"I worked sooooo hard on this\"... and a little smirk on their face because they thought that it should be really easy to fool me, the gullible foreign again... as the hours go by and I am walking through the errors one by one I could see their expression change... little by little, their hopes of passing being slowly crushed... and when they realized that I KNEW they cheated and I wasant going to give up any extra points. At this point they tried to cut short their appointment and leave I wouldn\\'t let them. \"We need to finish the review of your grades, its university policy\"... And I just kept going, extending their misery for one more hour or two... it was legal torture, plain and simple!\\n\\nIT WAS GLORIOUS!!\\n\\nAt the end, every single one of them left with a \"crushed soul\" look in their eyes and a FAIL in my class... they knew that I caught them, that I baited them and they fell for it... they ruined their vacation and their family vacations, spent money to travel back and forth, wasted precious summer time, got bored to death and have nothing to show for it. And... next year they will have to repeat the module...WITH ME!!\\n\\n\"I hope you enjoy your summer!! See you next year!!\"',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Velcome to the original notable source of news media by\\xa0Lucky ₃₃ a public intellectual declares OWENSCORP—Rick Owens, Michele Lamy, Elda Lanzo, Luca Ruggeri—steal 34.541,10 Euros from his company—CRUVOIR—agitating the Rick Owens Online discourse. The best tool for understanding corporate sentiment is the human mind. The following article can help you conduct OWENSCORP sentiment analysis—but it’s up to you to synthesize the information you find.\\n\\nTLDR: I am biased with a hope that a whole team of extraordinarily wealthy people who work for [Rick Owens](https://blog.cruvoir.com/hostility) is publicly humiliated as a karmic repercussion for their insane selfishness in a world in which the majority surrounding them had been so obviously suffering for so long. The fucking gutless monsters deserve it! A recount of a 'good heist' that came away with 34.541,10 Euros has the OWENSCORP partygoers on the edge of their seats.\\n\\nEven as\\xa0Rick Owens' and [Michele Lamy](http://blog.cruvoir.com/loss-for-words)'s world has grown to include directly operated stores in Paris, New York, Seoul, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, Miami, and Los Angeles, little has changed within OWENSCORP since its inception two decades ago. Luca Ruggeri, who is still CEO and commercial director, chuckles to himself as he watches his clients below trudge forth each morning to toil in their fields. Respectively, he still holds a shared 20 percent of the company—Rick Owens and Michele Lamy— though it’s safe to say that those shares have significantly increased in value. In 2010, OWENSCORP revenue was around $40 million. In 2012, that number was closer to $70 million; in 2013 it exceeded $100 million, in 2019 surpassed $140 million. And, though he once flirted with the idea of selling to an unnamed conglomerate, Rick Owens has grown his house without any outside help.\\n\\n“We’ve never had to take any outside investment, thank God.” Nor has he ever outsourced production or in-sourced a single design. His is not an atelier system where a team of young designers submits ideas for a boss’ approval. Instead, he designs every piece from every line bearing his name. “I’m greedy,” he says, meaning he wants all of that, the fun stuff, for himself. “Really, I wouldn’t know how to do it any other way.” And neither would Luca Ruggeri, who still holds the title for the no-holds-barred contest for the best capitalist thief, judged by God and Satan. Clients that have dealt with Luca Ruggeri awaken only to find themselves naked on a silver platter, an apple stuffed into their mouths, and OWENSCORP giants—Rick Owens, Michele Lamy, Elsa Lanzo, Luca Ruggeri—about to eat them. A mortician Luca Ruggeri arrives with a knife and a fork.\\n\\nCRUVOIR was destroyed by opportunistic looters during the BLM riots in Los Angeles, which resulted in almost a total loss of the store’s inventory and revenues (approximately $375,000 in damages).

It was a toxic train wreck of a relationship, but good god the sex was phenomenal, thus why it went on so long. \\n\\nI could look past the cheating, abuse, etc. wash my hands and walk away clean, but the last day I spoke to her, she messaged me asking if her and her new man (who happen to be a close mate) could stay on my Costco membership because they “couldn’t afford it”. \\n\\nThis is when I start my plan. I let her know they absolutely can stay on. The next day, I go in and change the account from basic to executive, so I could earn different rewards. This last year+ I’ve slowly watched as her yoga pants and pesto have paid for me to fly from Seattle to Boston to watch my favorite comedian for my birthday. 🤘🏼',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"One of my side-hustles is selling on eBay, and I've always prided myself on having 100% positive feedback by taking care of my customers.  One day I was checking my feedback and noticed a previous customer had left negative feedback, several weeks after the item had arrived, without ever contacting me to help resolve the issue.  In the feedback, he wrote that I was a bad seller because I sent him a basic widget instead of the deluxe widget.  My listing described the item exactly as the basic widget it was, including several pictures clearly showing the item was the basic widget.  I tried contacting the buyer to help resolve the issue and he ignored me.  I sent a request for feedback revision, which he ignored.\\n\\nAt this point, I moved from customer-care mode to revenge-mode.\\n\\nFirst, I looked up his Facebook account, which was surprisingly open to the public.  I proceeded to save pics of him bare-chested posing on vacation, as well of pics in his toys (boat, muscle car, etc.).\\n\\nSecond, I got on my throw-away Craigslist account connected to throw-away email and created 'Casual Encounter' M4M listings in every major metro in the US as well as his medium-sized city using all the pictured I had collected from his Facebook page.  I wrote that he had just gotten out of a long-term relationship and was seeking casual sex to forget his boyfriend.  In the last line, I included his cell phone # and wrote something along the lines of 'show me yours and I'll show you mine.  Please reply via text, NOT email'.\\n\\nHOLY COW!  I received over 100 emails to my spam account with pictures attached.  If I received pictures from this many people when I specifically stated 'text, NOT email', I can only imagine how his phone must have blown up for the next few days!\",\n",

I\\'m deathly allergic to peanuts, and I mean going to shock level bad, this will be important later. \\n\\nNow, in high school I was that quiet, always in the back of the class student. I was so quiet teachers think I appear out of nowhere and sometimes jump when I speak or so quiet that they don\\'t notice til I\\'m standing in front or next to them. \\n\\nWell, one day I\\'m in my normal spot with raincoat hanging off the back of my chair. Listening to the teacher and doodling in my sketch book. Then I noticed I needed to go to the bathroom. After asking the teacher for a pass, I left the room. I was gone for around 7 or 9 minutes.\\n\\nOnce I return to the class it\\'s time to go home. Then I noticed it. The bane of my existence laying on the desk in the middle of the room. My raincoat with a long smear of peanut butter on it. The raincoat I needed to get home in poring rain that afternoon laying and a smiling @$$ hole of a class clown right next to it. Everyone in the class looked at him then me. I struck mute for a few minutes before every alarm bell in my head went off and the momery of being told hospital that I dead three times and they almost didn\\'t get me back came to mind. \\n\\nI snapped yelling at him asking if he knew what he had just done. My mind then blackout from rage and fear. When I came to my Mom was there, extremely pissed and yelling what happened. The student relation worker (that what think they were called) informed my Mom of the \"prank\" and that police were called.\\n\\nNow, I was tired from my freak out and didn\\'t pay attention after the \\'police were called\\' I just wanted to go home. We stayed there for at least a half a hour before the police showed up. They spoke with the staff and my Mom. After hearing everything, seeing my doctor\\'s note and seeing the smear of peanut butter on it. They revealed the my Mom that the class clown can be arrested for attempted murder as it was a threat to my life. And well Mom indeed agreed. As Mom and I lefted, we saw the police confronting the clown. Who was terrified of what he had done. He then says \"It was a prank.\" Hearing this Mom yelled at him then took me home. \\n\\nThat day I learned that he wouldn\\'t got away with it and slept well that night.',\n",

He screwed off and we left him behind (as in cutting all contact with him).\\n\\nMax one day claims he wants revenge by bullying me and my best friends\\' friend which I will call \"Nelson\" now Nelson wasn\\'t a bad kid at all he was getting attacked by the said enemy for being annoying, the enemy said things that were extremely hurtful, Max thrives on this but Nelson didn\\'t care about the threats at all because he knew they couldn\\'t do anything to him. Max also tried getting my best friend hacked just for not being his friend anymore.\\n\\nA month later Max manages to get my house address (I still don\\'t know how he did it) and he proceeds to order pizza to my house one night, I knew it was him because the delivery guy said \"delivery for Max\" I don\\'t know why he used his own name to order the pizza, anyways I was scared and freaking out cause I thought he was done with us but no he went after us and started all this unnecessary drama, he had friends he brainwashed as well to be on his side and on top of that he\\'s 18 and we found out he was dating a 14 year old and had a sexual relationship with her. He denied ever sending pizza to my house and the relationship when I had the evidence at my disposal.\\n\\nHis lies went from \"pizza bombing does not exist\" (pizza bombing is when you order pizza to someone else\\'s house without consent). People believed this more and more to a point where his friends realized he was a liar and was called out as a pedophile. That didn\\'t stop him though as he made a portion of a community believe this was all \"cancel culture\" when it wasn\\'t. He also tried getting the person he groomed in danger which made her frightened.\\n\\nWhen I was absolutely sure it was Max who ordered the pizza to my house I planned on calling the police on him for everything he\\'s done, in the end he got community service for the pizza and the police took his computer away for everything he has done.',\n",
